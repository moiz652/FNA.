prompting an angry reaction from the US.\n\nThe European Commission said by allowing people to pay for a blue verified check mark on their profile, the platform "deceives users" because the firm is not "meaningfully verifying" who is behind the account.\n\n"This deception exposes users to scams, including impersonation frauds, as well as other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,"\n\nBut US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have criticised the EU regulator, accusing it of attacking and censoring US firms.\n\n"The European Commission\'s fine isn\'t just an attack on X, it\'s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments," Rubio wrote\n\n"The days of censoring Americans online are over."\n\nHis remarks were reposted by Musk, who added "absolutely".\n\nEarlier on Friday, FCC chair Brendan Carr had accused the Commission of targeting X merely because it was "a successful US tech company".\n\n"Europe is taxing Americans to subsidise a continent held back by Europe\'s own suffocating regulations," he wrote.\n\nTheir comments echo those made by US Vice-President JD Vance on Thursday.\n\nHe lashed out at the EU amid rumours of its forthcoming fine - claiming the platform was being punished "for not engaging in censorship".\n\n"The EU should be supporting free speech, not attacking American companies over garbage,"\n\nSocial media expert Matt Navarra said the comments showed the fine was not "just a punishment [but] a statement" of the EU\'s willingness to enforce its regulation of tech firms.\n\nIn addition to taking issue with its use of blue ticks, EU regulators said X was also failing to provide transparency around its adverts, and it was not giving researchers access to public data.\n\n"The fine issued today was calculated taking into account the nature of these infringements, their gravity in terms of affected EU users, and their duration," the Commission said.\n\nHenna Virkkunen, the regulator\'s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said it was "holding X responsible for undermining users\' rights and evading accountability".\n\n"Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU," she said.\n\nThe decision means X must tell the Commission how it will bring the allegedly violating measures into compliance with EU laws, or face further, periodic fines.\n\nThe action constitutes the Commission\'s first decision on a platform\'s "non-compliance" with its Digital Services Act (DSA) - one of two rulebooks online firms must follow in order to operate their services in the EU.\n\nThe DSA sets out obligations for platforms around content, data and advertising, while the Digital Markets Act establishes how companies should operate in order to benefit consumers and competition.\n\nSuch rules have come under increased scrutiny from US leaders, who warned against tougher regulation of tech firms by governments and regulators.\n\nMusk\'s shake-up to verification formed part of a sweeping set of changes he made after acquiring Twitter in late 2022.\n\nIt saw the previous system - which functioned similarly to other social media verification schemes displaying someone as verified if they supply proof of who they are - cast out and\n\nThis required people to pay a monthly subscription fee if they wanted a blue tick displayed next to their account name on the site.\n\nTo get a verified checkmark, an X account must have a display name and profile picture, a confirmed phone number  and have been active in the previous 30 days.\n\nThey also cannot be "misleading or deceptive" or have engaged in spam activity.\n\nMusk launched the new system as a way to incentivise people to subscribe and boost X\'s overall income.\n\nIt also gave blue tick holders a higher presence in replies, and was mooted as a way to tackle the amount of bots on the platform.\n\nBut it proved highly controversial, with warnings it might open users up to scams by impersonators or fake accounts and increase the profile of bad actors and\n\nMr Navarra said Musk\'s new system marked a departure from the way platforms usually verify users.\n\n"It\'s a trust signal not a transaction, but on X that was flipped," he told the BBC.\n\n"There\'s no meaningful ID check, there\'s no rigorous validation and I think that\'s where the EU has drawn the line," he said - adding X had made itself "an easy first target" for the Commission\'s scrutiny of deceptive design on social platforms.\n\nto follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 40, 414341), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 40, 414341)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0p50ej0w2o', 'title': "My husband would still be alive if he'd got Post Office compensation", 'body': 'A sub-postmaster whose life was ruined by the Post Office\'s faulty accounting software has died without receiving his full compensation.\n\nJonathan Armstrong passed away in October from a heart attack at the age of 58.\n\nHis widow, Sarah, is now looking into claiming damages against the Post Office for his death,  saying the "constant cycle of stress" after being wrongly accused of stealing due to\n\ntook its toll on her husband\'s health.\n\nThe Post Office said it was sincerely sorry to hear about Mr Armstrong\'s death while the government said it was "striving to deliver justice as swiftly as possible".\n\nSpeaking about her family\'s ordeal for the first time exclusively with the BBC, Sarah Armstrong said: "I truly believe that if we\'d been paid out five years ago, he would still be here."\n\nThe family also revealed that Jono, as he was known, had tried to take his own life.\n\nIt happened on the day auditors arrived to go through the accounts at his branch in Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex in 2014.\n\nBy then, the "losses" created by the faulty Horizon software had spiralled into tens of thousands of pounds and when Jono failed to come home Sarah feared the worst.\n\n"We knew things were bad. We didn\'t know where we were going wrong," she said, adding that the situation felt so desperate, they\'d spoken about potentially taking their own lives together.\n\n"So when I realised he hadn\'t come back, I thought that\'s what he had done."\n\nTheir daughter Becky drove to find Jono and by the time she arrived the emergency services had saved him.\n\nJono is one of 10 sub-postmasters known to have attempted suicide due to the scandal. The Post Office Inquiry also found that more than 13 may have killed themselves.\n\nJono was sectioned and spent nearly a month in hospital, followed by six weeks in a supervised residence.\n\nThe Armstrongs had moved to the UK from Zimbabwe in 2004, fleeing political unrest. A qualified accountant, Jono became a sub-postmaster two years later and Sarah ran the shop.\n\n"It was a lovely little Post Office," recalls Sarah. "We transformed it, quadrupling sales. It was very, very community based."\n\nThey won numerous awards including Post Office Retailer in 2014.\n\nBut when Jono finally came home\n\nhe found his contract had been terminated and the family faced a backlash from residents who believed he had been stealing.\n\nHe was "a broken man" suffering from anxiety, depression, high blood pressure and exacerbated diabetes, said Sarah.\n\nShe took on the role of sub-postmaster accepting the £43,000 of "losses", to avoid Jono being prosecuted. But she had shortfalls, too.\n\nBecky meanwhile had dropped out of university to run the shop and says she worried constantly about her dad.\n\n"When someone has attempted suicide, you don\'t know if they\'re going to do it again... he was a shell of what he used to be. He\'d just given up on life," says Becky, now 33.\n\nIn 2015, they managed to sell the business and moved to Gloucestershire to be closer to Becky\'s two other siblings.\n\nAfter Jono submitted his claim for compensation an offer was made two years later - but it was just under a third of what he had claimed for and he rejected it.\n\nIt took him a further two years to resubmit his claim because of the time it took to gather new information, including medical reports.\n\nBut after waiting seven months, his case was transferred in April into a new appeals process, the HSSA, run by the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). Jono passed away before securing an outcome.\n\n"He died without knowing, and that\'s heartbreaking to us, because he deserved so much better," says Becky.\n\nJono had only received an interim payment from the Post Office which he had used to buy a small caravan in a holiday park near Cirencester where Sarah still lives.\n\nSarah says Jono had been "obsessed\' about securing his full financial redress not just as vindication that he had done nothing wrong but to start a new life with his own permanent home and garden, "somewhere in the sunshine".\n\n"If he\'d had that compensation, I think he would have been OK. We wouldn\'t be worrying. He wanted to move away from England. He felt England hadn\'t been kind to him."\n\nBecky managed to complete her degree and is now a sports coach. She\'s also part of Lost Chances, the group formed to campaign on behalf of the adult children of affected sub-postmasters.\n\nShe and her dad had chosen music for her wedding next year, including a "daddy dance"  but she lost him just a few weeks later and now the planning has stopped.\n\n"I\'m heartbroken he\'s not here to walk me down the aisle," she says.\n\n"He was kind, caring, funny, really into his music, always with the worst Dad jokes. But he was someone you could always turn to."\n\nJono died just days before his 34th wedding anniversary. Sarah blames the Post Office for everything that\'s happened.\n\n"Now we\'ve got to fight for what he needed," she says.\n\nFour days after the BBC approached the DBT for comment, the Armstrongs received what their solicitor described as a significantly improved offer, which they are now considering.\n\nA Post Office spokesperson said: "Postmasters and their families have suffered years of pain. It has taken them too long to clear their names and, in many cases, to receive redress. We are sincerely sorry to hear about Mr Armstrong\'s death, and for his and his family\'s experiences."\n\nA government spokesperson said: "We offer our sincere condolences to the family of Jonathan Armstrong. We are acutely aware how pressing the issue of compensation is for so many of the postmasters which is why we are striving to deliver justice as swiftly as possible."\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 41, 885517), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 41, 885517)}

I would be surprised," Daunt says.\n\n"Who\'s to know? [Technology firms] are spending trillions and trillions on AI and maybe it\'s going to produce the next War and Peace.\n\n"And if people want to read that book, AI-generated or not, we will be selling it - as long as it doesn\'t pretend to [be] something that it isn\'t.\n\n"We as booksellers would certainly naturally and instinctively disdain it," Daunt said.\n\nReaders value a connection with the author "that does require a real person", he added. Any AI-generated book would always be clearly labelled as such.\n\nThe softly spoken former banker has overturned convention before.\n\nWhen he took over at Waterstones in 2011, he took the bold decision to end the practice of publishers paying to have their books displayed prominently in stores. It cost him £27m in lost revenue and prompted a "nervous breakdown" among publishers, he said, but it paid off and in 2016 the company returned to profit.\n\nNow Waterstones staff write their own book recommendations, choose books of the month, and the store manager selects what goes on the display tables.\n\nAs well as books, the chain stocks pens, reading lights, games, wrapping paper and other stationery.\n\nThe strategy has helped it defy the decline on the High Street, with around 10 new stores opening a year, and profits in 2024 of £33m against sales of £528m.\n\nWaterstones is part of a wider stable, including Foyles and Blackwell\'s, owned by  hedge fund Elliott Advisers.\n\nDaunt has also been appointed chief executive of Barnes and Noble, the large US bookstore chain also owned by Elliot Advisers.\n\nSuccess on both sides of the Atlantic has led to speculation that shares in Waterstones and Barnes and Noble could be jointly floated in either New York or London.\n\n"It feels like an inevitability and probably better than being flipped to the next private equity person," says Daunt.\n\nPrivate owners naturally aim to sell businesses on, he points out. "It\'s what they do."\n\nBut it is not clear that London, which he says has been "suffering" as a location for initial public offerings lately, would be considered suitable.\n\n"We\'re based out of London but we have a huge American business; Barnes and Noble is much larger than Waterstones."\n\nAs for last week\'s Budget, Daunt says it sometimes feels like he might be "the only person who is sympathetic" to the situation the chancellor is in.\n\nThe government has drawn the ire of the business community for raising employer National Insurance and the minimum wage and not coming up with more growth-boosting measures.\n\nBut the Budget included changes that were "very helpful" to companies like his, said Daunt.\n\nBusiness rates will be lower for retailers operating out of small sites, while larger business properties, like warehouses will pay more.\n\nDaunt said that although Waterstones does have larger premises, levelling the playing field between High Street and online retailers was something he has been calling for for a long time.\n\nWith the days of advent now ticking past, the company is well into the part of the year when Waterstones makes about 70% of its annual profit.\n\nHe says the post-pandemic rebound, with people returning to bookshops, does not seem to have gone away.\n\nPersonally he has also retained his love of reading, even after 36 years in the industry. But he does admit to having one bad book habit.\n\n"Because I read professionally, I do a rather awful thing which is start a lot of books and then not finish them.\n\n"I love the excitement of opening up a first novel and not knowing what\'s going to come of it. But if it isn\'t quite that good, I\'ll just move on."\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 43, 170791), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 43, 170791)}

Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.\n\nLabelling it a "big day" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a "rare opportunity" to set Netflix up for success "for decades to come".\n\nDavid Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine "two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world".\n\n"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world\'s most resonant stories for generations to come," he said.\n\nThe cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company\'s debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.\n\nThe boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.\n\nSome in the film industry have criticised the agreement.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America\'s East and West branches issued a joint statement on Friday saying "this merger must be blocked".\n\n"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers," it said.\n\nMichael O\'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed "an unprecedented threat" to the global cinema business.\n\n"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world," he said.\n\nNetflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.\n\nIts global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe.\n\nHowever, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.\n\nPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was "a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming".\n\nBut he warned that while the "surprising move" made sense for Warner Bros, it could "provide a headache for Netflix" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.\n\nWhile the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October.\n\nWarner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.\n\nAhead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\n\n"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood," he said.\n\nMr Harrington said there was likely to be "big reductions" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.\n\nFor consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\n\n"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues."\n\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had "offered an olive branch" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\n\n"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made," she said.\n\n"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 44, 271305), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 44, 271305)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y937w7xl7o', 'title': "Shoppers loved the 'fabric queen'. Then, order by order, her story fell apart", 'body': 'At 6ft tall and plus-size, shop-bought clothes had never fitted Maree O\'Connor well.\n\nSewing offered her a solution - allowing her to use beautiful fabrics to make garments that fit just right.\n\nOne day, while on the lookout for colourful prints to make new dresses, she spotted some "amazing" fabrics being sold online.\n\nEnticed by a yellow floral pattern and another black-and-white abstract design, she splashed out $600 (£450, A$900) on three orders.\n\nMonths later, none had arrived.\n\nIt was October 2024, and tired of waiting, the legal studies teacher from Melbourne, Australia, decided to set up a Facebook group to try to find out if anyone else was in the same boat.\n\nThe group exploded. Within two weeks it had drawn hundreds of members, according to Ms O\'Connor.\n\nShe had unearthed a scandal that would consume the sewing world - from China to Europe, to the US.\n\nIn the group, other sewing enthusiasts detailed how they too had been waiting months - and in some cases years - for fabrics to arrive, while a supplier alleged it was owed tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAt the centre of the controversy was globally renowned designer, Nerida Hansen.\n\nHer company had grown rapidly during the pandemic, when she made a name for herself selling bold, distinctive fashion prints that set her shop apart from other retailers.\n\nPopular with sewists - as members of the sewing community call themselves - around the world, her fabrics often appeared in influencers\' Instagram posts. Some newspapers had even dubbed her Australia\'s queen of fabrics.\n\n"People liked what she was doing and producing," said UK-based artist Gabriela Larios, who has worked with Ms Hansen.\n\n"My impression of her was that she was doing something different and new in Australia," added Sarah Rowe, another artist who worked with Ms Hansen. "I was impressed by her, she was formidable."\n\nThat\'s exactly what excited Bergen Anderson, who ordered more than $3,300 (£2,500; A$5,000) of Ms Hansen\'s fabrics in 2024.\n\nShe planned to use them to make clothes which she would sell through her US-based children\'s clothing business.\n\nBut, as in Ms O\'Connor\'s experience, none of Ms Anderson\'s goods arrived within the eight-week window that was promised.\n\nInstead, she received a number of what she described as "generic" emails, saying her orders were soon to be printed and shipped.\n\nShe also received a number of emails from Ms Hansen saying suppliers were delayed sending goods because of events like national holidays.\n\n"It was every excuse under the sun," Ms Anderson said.\n\nFrustrated and in search of answers, she too stumbled upon Ms O\'Connor\'s Facebook group.\n\nIn it, she found customers wondering where their money had gone - and why the company was still accepting orders even though so many people were saying their fabrics hadn\'t been printed or shipped.\n\nSuspicious of Ms Hansen\'s business practices, Ms O\'Connor encouraged customers to request refunds and dispute transactions with their banks.\n\nMs Anderson only managed to get two out of three payments reversed through her bank, meaning she was still $808 (£606; A$1,224) out of pocket.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Hansen had become aware of the Facebook group and contacted Ms O\'Connor asking for it to be taken down, claiming that content posted in the group was defamatory - a claim Ms O\'Connor rejected.\n\nMs O\'Connor said Ms Hansen also offered her an immediate refund if she no longer wished to wait for her goods.\n\n"I got my refund pretty much straight away, because she wanted to shut me up."\n\nBut she decided not to shut up - or delete the group.\n\n"She was just going to continue to do what she was doing, and take money from people because people were siloed right, they didn\'t know what was going on."\n\nIn the group people were sounding alarm bells about announcements from Ms Hansen saying she was rebranding, worried about what that would mean for their undelivered orders.\n\nMs Hansen went on to trade under a number of different business names online.\n\nBy then the group had grown beyond disgruntled customers to also include Nerida Hansen\'s suppliers.\n\nWilliam Shan worked for a supplier in China that sold material to Ms Hansen\'s company - until, he said, the payments stopped.\n\nHe was "helpless" when he "accidentally discovered" the Facebook group, he said.\n\nMr Shan alleged Ms Hansen\'s firm failed to pay for two fabric shipments worth $52,000 (£39,000; A$78,700) in 2022.\n\nHe said he initially felt sympathy for Ms Hansen, who he thought "may have encountered difficulties".\n\nHe continued supplying her in the hope it would "help her recover as soon as possible and collect her [company\'s] debts".\n\nBut he says later orders - worth thousands of dollars - also went unpaid.\n\n"We [trusted Nerida] too much. From 2020 to the end of 2021, Nerida\'s credit [had] been consistently good. So we did this stupid thing of continuing to supply her," Mr Shan said.\n\nMr Shan\'s company said it had hired numerous lawyers to try to recover the money owed by Ms Hansen\'s companies, but she and her business associates stopped communicating.\n\nThe BBC also spoke to 11 artists and illustrators who said they had not been paid for their work with Ms Hansen\'s brand.\n\nClémence Albertus, based in France, said she had been approached by Ms Hansen at an art fair in Paris about collaborating on fabric prints.\n\nGiven Ms Hansen was "really known for her fabrics", Ms Albertus said she chose to trust her.\n\nAccording to Ms Albertus, Ms Hansen wanted to license one of her designs to be sold in collaboration with a large European fabric retailer called Verhees - an opportunity Ms Albertus didn\'t want to miss out on.\n\nBut after sending over her design, a delicate floral print, she heard nothing from Ms Hansen for months.\n\n"I thought Verhees changed their mind, or that the collaboration Nerida x Verhees failed," Ms Albertus said.\n\nThat was until one day in August last year, when she discovered her pattern "by chance" for sale on the Verhees website. She said it had been edited in different colourways without her consultation.\n\nMs Albertus contacted Ms Hansen numerous times asking about royalty statements and payment details but is yet to receive any money.\n\n"It has been a real deception," she said, adding that she estimates she is owed €2,000-€4,000 (£1750-3500; A$3,500-7,000).\n\nVerhees told the BBC it was not responsible for royalty payments owed to designers featured in its collection, and that Ms Hansen was solely responsible for paying these.\n\nIt added it had now suspended the Nerida Hansen x Verhees collaboration.\n\nNot all the artists who spoke to the BBC felt Ms Hansen was totally to blame for the lack of payments from her businesses.\n\nBron Alexander, based in New Zealand, said while she was owed payments for previous projects with Ms Hansen, it was her own fault she hadn\'t been paid for her Verhees collection work as she\'d failed to provide invoices when asked by Ms Hansen\'s team.\n\nMs Alexander added that she believed Ms Hansen was a "visionary" and said she had "much empathy" for her financial situation. "She only ever wanted us [artists] to be successful."\n\nOthers insisted business simply wasn\'t Ms Hansen\'s forte.\n\n"I truly believe she wanted the best for everybody, I truly believe she wanted to be able to deliver, I truly believe she wanted to be able to pay everybody," said Sarah Rowe, an artist who used to collaborate with Ms Hansen and is not owed any money. "I really believe she had good intentions to do all those things, and I also believe business is not her jam."\n\nMs O\'Connor felt differently.\n\n"I think she\'s quite intentional in what she\'s doing," she said. "If she was a disorganised businesswoman she would have quit a while ago."\n\nIn September 2025, nearly a year after Ms O\'Connor started the Facebook group, a public warning against Ms Hansen and her businesses was issued by the Victoria state consumer rights agency.\n\nIt was the result of multiple complaints - Ms O\'Connor had advised fellow customers on the group to report their experiences to Australian authorities.\n\n"I urge consumers to be wary about purchasing goods from Hansen\'s online platforms or engaging further with Hansen," Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) director Nicole Rich said.\n\nThe warning said that over the course of one year, the agency had been contacted more than 120 times by customers claiming to have lost more than $19,800 (£14,900; A$30,000) in purchases.\n\nIt also said Ms Hansen had operated online under a range of business names, including Indigo Palm, The Kind Merch Co, Nerida Hansen Fabrics, Rebel Quilts, Australian Surface Art Collective, Fabric and Design and Nerida Hansen Print and Textiles. Ms Hansen said this was untrue, denying she used all of these to trade.\n\nAfter the warning was issued, Ms Hansen announced she would be shutting down her businesses by the end of the month to start a new career.\n\nBut she continued promoting fabric sales on the website domain names Global De-stash and neridahansen.com into November.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Ms Hansen admitted she had made some "very poor" decisions relating to her businesses, adding her actions had caused her "great shame and embarrassment".\n\nShe said she had experienced financial difficulties that led to her liquidating her company in late 2022 - before opening a new one in a new name.\n\nFollowing that, she said she fell further behind with orders in 2024, citing supplier issues and business mismanagement, but insisted she was still in control of the situation.\n\n"Even though I mismanaged orders terribly I was steering my own business wheel," she said.\n\nShe had intended to have all orders completed by the end of January 2025, she said, but the creation of the Facebook group had led to a wave of refund requests and bank chargebacks being submitted all at the same time.\n\nThis left the business overwhelmed, Ms Hansen said, and caused her trading account to be frozen.\n\nShe still intended to fulfil every order and refund owed to her customers, she stated, but did not currently have the means to do so.\n\nShe alleged the attention brought to her businesses online by Ms O\'Connor\'s Facebook group had amounted to "horrific social media harassment" and defamation.\n\nShe claimed Ms O\'Connor went beyond advocating for justice online. She accused her of encouraging others in the Facebook group to engage in what she describes as amounting to "digital stalking" and "physical stalking", and that Ms O\'Connor "publicly made deliberate attempts to sabotage [her] livelihood".\n\nMs O\'Connor disputed these allegations saying they were "outrageous".\n\n"Customers being persistent and demanding in terms of seeking a refund or product that the vendor had happily taken money for is not harassment," she said.\n\nDespite everything that has happened, Ms O\'Connor is determined to continue sewing - though she insists she will never wear any of Nerida Hansen\'s designs again.\n\nShe will continue to fight until Ms Hansen\'s businesses are shut down, she says.\n\n"Some people are still awaiting justice and we hope that can be achieved."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 45, 897387), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 45, 897387)}

But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.\n\nWarner Bros is one of the studios that defined Hollywood, creating classics such as Casablanca and the The Exorcist.\n\nBut this takeover is an illustration of how cinema\'s golden age has faded.\n\nThe trajectory is clear, Forrester\'s Mr Proulx said, the future is "all-streaming".\n\n"With this deal it is official: legacy media is ending."\n\nNetflix has promised to keep releasing films in cinemas, a decision that makes some sense as it will be acquiring the DC superhero franchise, films that do very well in movie theatres.\n\nBut not everyone believes that will remain a priority for the streamer.\n\nAfter all, earlier this year Netflix\'s co-chief executive officer Ted Sarandos said he believed movie-going was an "outdated concept". And the consolidation touches a nerve in an industry already wrestling with earlier job cuts, decline in productions and the threat of artificial intelligence.\n\nTitanic director James Cameron was one of many in Hollywood to greet the deal with dismay, warning just before it was announced, that he thought it would prove a "disaster"  for the industry.\n\nCompletion of the deal is far from certain.\n\nFirst, Warner Brothers Discovery has to complete the spin-off of the parts of its business that it is not selling to Netflix, including CNN, Discovery and Eurosport.\n\nMeanwhile rival suitor Paramount Skydance, which had hoped to buy the entire Warner Brothers Discovery business, may yet try to convince shareholders it can offer a better alternative.\n\nThe biggest question however, is whether the deal will get approval from competition regulators in the US and Europe - something that could pose a major challenge.\n\nIn Washington lawmakers from both parties have already chimed in against the deal, citing worries it will lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices.\n\nMr Sarandos said Netflix, which has to pay Warner Brothers $5.8bn if the deal falls apart, was "highly confident" it would win approval.\n\nIt will hinge in part on how regulators define the competitive landscape, said Jonathan Barnett, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.\n\nIf regulators only look at video streaming, Netflix\'s increased share of the market could raise significant red flags. But if regulators adopt a broader definition, one that includes cable and broadcast TV and even YouTube as Netflix\'s competitors "the concentration concerns become less and less", he said.\n\nRebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, said usually a merger like this would be a "clear-cut case for a challenge", typically pushing for better terms for consumers.\n\nThis time, she is worried the Trump administration might put pressure on Netflix over questions like diversity and political bias, as has happened in other cases.\n\nLooming over the debate is whether President Donald Trump will weigh in.\n\nThis administration has promised a lighter regulatory touch when it comes to mergers.\n\nBut the president has spoken highly of Paramount Skydance\'s owners, the tech billionaire and Republican donor Larry Ellison and his son David who are behind the rival bid for Warner Bros. And Trump has always shown a keen interest in the media and entertainment industry.\n\nThere has been no comment from competition regulators in the US, but a senior Trump administration official told CNBC that it views Netflix\'s bid for Warner Bros with "heavy scepticism".', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 50, 596656), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 50, 596656)}

This is believed to be Mr Fernandez, who is the only director to leave the company since 2019.\n\nLast summer he sold his house in North London for £1.3m, according to Land Registry documents, and is believed to have left the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, vVoosh owes £50,000 to one of Ms Ferguson\'s companies, La Luna Investments, which also held just under 1% of the company\'s shares.\n\nDocuments show the firm had more than 60 other small shareholders - many with addresses in Essex and London, though a few American addresses also appear.\n\nThe administrators said that there was "significant uncertainty" over how much money the company\'s creditors would get back once the company was wound up.\n\nOne of the firm\'s American backers, Mark Guzy, has put more than £400,000 into the company to preserve "certain essential services" and protect the value of its software platform, which is the company\'s main remaining asset.\n\nvVoosh originally intended to share 10% of its profits with a charitable foundation.\n\nThe BBC understands that the Charity Commission has now begun the process of removing vVoosh Charitable Foundation from the register of charities, on the basis that it does not operate.\n\nIt is more than four-and-a-half years overdue with its reporting.\n\nHMRC declined to respond to questions about the tax credits. Mr Guzy and the other directors of vVoosh declined to comment.\n\nEarlier this month Mr Fernandez denied taking money out of the firm, according to the Times.\n\nHe told the newspaper that allegation would be "disproven in the course of legal proceedings".\n\nMs Ferguson, 66, lost her duchess title when her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, relinquished use of his Duke of York title over his links with Epstein. He has since been stripped of the title of prince as well.\n\nLast month it emerged that\n\nfirm had agreed to pay her up to £1.4m for acting as a "brand ambassador" - that firm also failed, allegedly costing investors millions. Its co-founder denied misconduct and said he was working to repay backers.\n\nIn September, a number of charities\n\nor ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her "supreme friend" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\nMr Fernandez went to school at Billericay in Essex, and was a soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe then held senior sales roles at a number of tech companies before founding vVoosh in 2010.\n\nHe was regularly photographed with the then duchess in 2015 and 2016, and they attended Sir Bob Geldof\'s wedding together, but she denied rumours they were a couple, saying they were just "good friends".', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 53, 53853), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 5, 53, 53853)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9865l8540eo', 'title': "How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump", 'body': 'This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit.\n\nThe candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina\'s entire annual economic output.\n\nRather than \'trimming the fat\', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as "la casta" - the caste.\n\nMilei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a "libertarian superhero" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television.\n\nAccording to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation.\n\nYet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%.\n\nThe UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a "template" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as "my favourite president".\n\nThey will meet in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nForeign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington\'s decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina\'s currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei\'s fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei\'s meeting will hail the deal.\n\nYet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei\'s reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes.\n\n"He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by \'la casta\' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen," says Mercedes D\'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate.\n\nBut, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. "The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste."\n\nMilei\'s critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession.\n\nMilei has created a paradox.\n\nOn paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project.\n\nWith midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains?\n\nAround 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. "We\'re all going backwards economically," he says. "I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees."\n\nFor three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them.\n\nNow, Mr Sobol says he can\'t afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he\'s deciding what his family will have to go without too.\n\nArgentina\'s multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes "daily" closures and job losses.\n\nUnlike Trump\'s approach of raising tariffs to promote "America First", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports.\n\n"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don\'t pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field," Mr Galfione argues.\n\nHe believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. "Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more."\n\nMr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes.\n\nAnd yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines.\n\nIn the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts.\n\nAs well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF.\n\n"The demand for public spending was brutal," argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei.\n\n"Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn\'t recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending."\n\nInflation ate away the peso currency\'s purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight.\n\n"Everything was a huge mess," explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria.\n\n"People felt money slipping like water through their fingers."\n\nFor many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change.\n\nHe went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting \'afuera!\' - \'out!\'\n\nAmong other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices.\n\nHis initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell.\n\nWhen I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher\'s face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was "brilliant."\n\nLast month one British newspaper described Milei\'s own approach as having "echoes of Thatcherism".\n\nMiguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei\'s economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. "When you bear in mind the starting point, that\'s a huge accomplishment," he says.\n\nHe believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less.\n\nBut Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case.\n\nJavier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina\'s Congress.\n\n"Being so detached kind of shields him," Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of "signs of empathy in public life".\n\nOn 7 September Milei\'s party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt.\n\nFinancial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year.\n\nTrump\'s £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D\'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in "people\'s real lives".\n\n"We\'re going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina\'s infrastructure."\n\nSome of Milei\'s supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to "break" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power.\n\n"Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back," says Mr Boggiano. "I think Milei will become a model for other countries."\n\nOthers are unsure. "There is some stability which helps things not to explode," said Mr Cibils. "But I think that stability is also a mirage."\n\nMilei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country\'s reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn\'t crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year.\n\nOne former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei\'s strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can\'t pay its debts.\n\n"If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it\'s a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed," says the economist.\n\nThe left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending.\n\nAs to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for.\n\nMany workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a "normalisation".\n\nBut even as leaders abroad watch Milei\'s experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it.\n\nIf normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the \'macro\' successes.\n\n"He has no political expertise, and I think you need it," Prof Rapetti argues.\n\nStill, he believes it is too early to judge: "We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn\'t finished."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 1, 606172), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 1, 606172)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397n3jl3z8o', 'title': 'The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high', 'body': 'That\'s a rise of 134% since 2020, and it\'s up 29% just in the past year.\n\nIn cafes and restaurants it\'s a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ.\n\nOne colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price.\n\nYet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs.\n\nThe public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit.\n\nAll of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again.\n\nPlus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\nIt is a perfect storm.\n\nYet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you\'ll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive.\n\nIt all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?\n\nWhere else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two.\n\nThe US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn\'t taste like turpentine.\n\nOrange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added.\n\nWW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid.\n\nIt was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being "better for your health".\n\nWestern consumption of orange juice surged.\n\nFlash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.\n\nAt an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald.\n\nHis firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine.\n\nToday it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers.\n\nBut prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year.\n\nThis followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.\n\n"Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels," Maxim tells me. "At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo.\n\n"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers."\n\nUntil 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n\nProducers have tried to look beyond South America but it\'s not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil.\n\nMorocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)\n\nEven within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates.\n\nIn a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn\'t, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.\n\nFlorida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening.\n\nOne problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet.\n\n"Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice \'Florida Orange\'," says Maxim McDonald.\n\n"It\'s very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it\'s too expensive."\n\nOne of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes.\n\nTropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it.\n\nOne of Tropicana\'s recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an "essentials" brand of orange juice "blends" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it.\n\nThese developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.\n\nThen there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs.\n\nOranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it.\n\nUS exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to "forgo Florida orange juice".\n\nThe Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices.\n\nIn 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this.\n\nAnd while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.\n\nThen there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures.\n\nThe rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles.\n\nIn August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago.\n\nThough this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice.\n\n"When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years," suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData.\n\nDemand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.\n\nUltimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse.\n\n"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced," says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, "Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers."\n\nOthers in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year\'s high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains.\n\nAs for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it.\n\nIt\'s a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills.\n\nBut the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.\n\nOranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time.\n\n"It might be the retailers didn\'t full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it\'s a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got," says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.\n\nUltimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected.\n\n"What we don\'t know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It\'s difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts."\n\nThere is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?\n\nA 2024 government report on food security noted: "The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood...\n\n"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks."\n\nAnd so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 3, 545279), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 3, 545279)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkgxeeyzno', 'title': 'The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis', 'body': '"Everyone comes in here, it\'s very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries," says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. "It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"\n\nThe store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nInstead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street.\n\nMore than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That\'s after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid "challenging trading conditions".\n\nIt does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year.\n\nElsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK\'s biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales.\n\nThese places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops.\n\nSo why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time?\n\nOne thing is clear - we\'re not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed.\n\n"[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops," says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. "[They\'re doing this] by saying, \'These are things I\'m going to buy from you.\'\n\n"They know their prices inside out."\n\nSometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices.\n\nBut that\'s not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition.\n\nAll big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year\'s Budget, but it\'s more difficult when you\'re selling the cheapest products because there\'s less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers.\n\nFor pound shops in particular, it\'s even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn\'t what it used to be.\n\nAfter inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today.\n\nChris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail\'s bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago.\n\nIn 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It\'s now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above.\n\n"We realised the pound game wasn\'t going to work any more," he says. "What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn\'t get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."\n\nBut Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right.\n\nHis Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries.\n\n"We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they\'re going to buy it," he declares.\n\nAs for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can\'t he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers.\n\n"We\'ve got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices," he says.\n\nSo, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of "extra margin".\n\nIf you don\'t get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel.\n\nThe father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later.\n\n"They just didn\'t understand the discount business," he argues. "They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."\n\nWilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nPoundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making.\n\nThe business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices.\n\nIts owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn\'t popular with shoppers.\n\n"Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple," says Catherine Shuttleworth.\n\nBut she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan.\n\nThis has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead.\n\nThe main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then.\n\nBack in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents.\n\nAnd shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains.\n\nDiscount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes.\n\nBy 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car.\n\nBut budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis.\n\nNot only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of "extreme discounting" online to contend with.\n\nToday, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops\' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There\'s also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers.\n\n"AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it\'s growing," says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel.\n\nSales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period.\n\nAmazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul.\n\n"If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you\'d find on Temu etc, so if Amazon\'s doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it\'s notable," says Mr Carroll.\n\n"There\'s a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn\'t slowing down, and I think there\'s much more to come."\n\nThere are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock.\n\n"As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that," she says.\n\n"It\'s not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."\n\nThe danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market.\n\nAll this coupled with a "cost-of-business crisis" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers\' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth.\n\n"You\'ve got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you\'re at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it\'s super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there\'s so many people in that market.\n\n"But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."\n\nIt\'s not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently.\n\nThe Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too.\n\nSavers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland\'s Peckham store space.\n\nOneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs.\n\n"Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."\n\nAs for current trading, he says, he is getting by. "We\'re not saying we\'re earning fortunes of money. We\'re not - but we\'re paying our way, and we\'re just waiting for better times."\n\nHis focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading.\n\n"It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas," he says.\n\nCatherine Shuttleworth reckons that\'s where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. "They\'re a great place to go and deck your house out."\n\nBut also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park.\n\n"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby," she adds, "but for others it\'s an absolute necessity."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 9, 925166), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 9, 925166)}

Or more precisely, a chunky chart-filled analysis of the Budget, assessing the cost of government policies, published by a team that sits in a far corner of the Ministry of Justice building - one that few people outside this closed world know much about.\n\nYet it\'s also a department that has extraordinary influence over economic policy.\n\nNow a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy.\n\nAnd indeed whether its chairman, Richard Hughes, a Harvard-educated former Treasury mandarin, has in fact become as important as the real chancellor.\n\nLou Haigh, a former Labour Cabinet minister, has called the OBR an "unelected institution dictating the limits of government ambition". And just last week the Trades Union Congress accused the "unaccountable OBR" of being a "straitjacket on growth".\n\nSo, ahead of Wednesday\'s Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog - and if so, could this partly be at Labour\'s own hand for having changed the department\'s role in the first place?\n\nBack in March, just after the Spring Statement, I asked Richard Hughes for his response to the critique that had been prevalent even then that the OBR is all-powerful.\n\nHis answer, tinged with an uncharacteristic air of exasperation, was firm.\n\n"The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament in legislation," he insisted. "And those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of government policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on the course to meet her fiscal rules.\n\n"The chancellor chooses the policies she wants to implement. She chooses the rules she set for herself, and if she wants to change those rules, she can change those rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies."\n\nOfficially the OBR monitors the UK government\'s spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending.\n\nYet the irony in the timing of the questions around its influence is that they follow the chancellor herself giving the forecaster even more independence and authority.\n\nWhat\'s more, she herself appoints, with the consent of the Treasury Select Committee, the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, who lead the OBR.\n\nWhen Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives\' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets.\n\nAt the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration\'s ability to announce those policy changes. The new law ensures this could not happen again.\n\nIt also gives the OBR the ability to question government assumptions about spending by departments, which it did not have before, and provides direct access to Treasury data to help them do this.\n\nEmpowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves\'s plan.\n\nThe Chancellor believed that giving the forecaster more independence and influence would improve credibility in UK tax and spending policy; the memories of the Truss-Kwarteng mini-Budget may well have been front of mind.\n\nAnd yet by September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury\'s own reported frustrations with the OBR were circulating.\n\nWhen I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that "promises made are constantly not kept" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: "The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy."\n\nYet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR\'s true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest.\n\nEven before Labour\'s law change, the then-director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, argued that we should be "highly cautious" about moving towards what he described as a "more powerful fiscal technocracy".\n\n"The OBR has brought discipline and transparency to the fiscal policymaking process, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing," he claimed. "Choices over how much to tax, spend and borrow are not narrow, technical questions.\n\n"They are inescapably political."\n\nAt the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. Productivity plays a key role in long-term growth prospects and therefore can influence Budget decisions.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves\'s Budget black hole.\n\nThis all has knock-on consequences for any chancellor.\n\nFor example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024.\n\nBut the bigger issue is how much credit the government should get for "pro-growth measures", such as planning reform or easier post-Brexit trade terms with Europe. The more this is forecast to help medium-term growth, the smaller the gap in the Budget maths.\n\nSome on the Labour left have identified the OBR as a core structural reason why a government with a massive majority cannot act decisively on its instincts. A version of that view has spread now to some on the Labour right too.\n\nPraful Nargund, director of the Good Growth Foundation, who unsuccessfully stood against Jeremy Corbyn in last year\'s general election, said last week: "The Office for Budget Responsibility was created to enforce austerity. But in its attempt to restore credibility, it has pushed us further down the spending-cut rabbit hole without an end in sight.\n\n"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn\'t built for the task."\n\nBut Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them.\n\nIn late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled "Reconstruction".\n\nBritish building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy.\n\nIt drew little attention, yet it was from this pamphlet that the idea of the OBR was born.\n\nThe office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011.\n\nYet Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was going to cause the coalition government some problems.\n\nTake the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s.\n\nIt prompted my BBC colleague Norman Smith to describe the "road-to-Wigan-pier" style austerity, (a reference to the George Orwell\'s indictment of living conditions in the industrial north of England).\n\nSince then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a "deep state" played a part in bringing down her brief government - "the economic establishment, who fundamentally don\'t want the status quo to change", as she put it.\n\nAs for the OBR, she once said: "Treasury officials go from the Treasury to the Bank of England, to the OBR to the Resolution Foundation. They go to Goldman Sachs, they… it\'s the same people."\n\nDuring the Johnson-Sunak era, the OBR also published charts that the sitting government would not have welcomed, which showed the tax burden reaching post-World War Two highs.\n\nIt is the Labour government that strengthened the OBR - and the distinguished CVs of the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee ensure that it is taken seriously.\n\nRichard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England\'s monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nInsiders have told me there will be important changes to how the dynamic between the OBR and the Treasury will function in future.\n\nIn essence, the OBR\'s judgement of the amount of room for manoeuvre - the so-called "headroom" calculation - will now only be made once a year, from this Budget onwards. So, the tense process of the Treasury waiting on every bit of number crunching from the OBR will happen only in the run up to a full Budget.\n\nIt is a recognition that the current system has led to an ever-spinning hamster wheel of tax rise speculation.\n\nHowever, defenders of the OBR say it is not the fault of the forecaster. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advises the UK that raising the headroom is the best way to stop the doom loop of tax-rise speculation harming consumer and business sentiment.\n\nThe chancellor has all but announced her strategy to increase headroom figures at the Budget. The amount will be closely watched in the markets.\n\nUltimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR\'s role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.\n\nPlus, even if the OBR did not exist, the government\'s Budget decisions would still be constrained by the reaction of markets.\n\nThe UK is, after all, reliant on the "kindness of strangers" - foreign buyers of our debt. As the Chancellor points out now, they are increasingly likely these days to be a foreign hedge fund than a UK pension or insurance company.\n\nSo, those who now want to diminish the role of the OBR, will have to demonstrate alternative and convincing means of proving their own credibility, both on the numbers and on their political authority to drive through policies.\n\nAnd yet other countries do manage without institutions such as this. So, for now, there is a serious debate emerging at this Budget, not just about the Chancellor\'s policies. The role, record, and future of the OBR is definitively in play.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 10, 127916), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 10, 127916)}

That is in large part down to the chancellor\'s decision to scrap the limit on bigger families getting some extra benefits.\n\nThe prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it\'s not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. He\'ll also make the case the Budget will help families by easing energy bills and freezing rail fares.\n\nAnd the long-awaited strategy on child poverty will likely see the light of day towards the end of the week.\n\nIt\'s about as clear an example of a Labour-friendly policy as there could be - redistributing taxpayers\' cash to the least well-off.\n\nOne government source described it as a "restatement of values, something that MPs wanted to see, government being more bold about what it believes in and what a Labour government is".\n\nIn other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job.\n\nWhile it\'s not a policy that is universally popular with the public, the decision makes it easier for the leadership to get their backbenchers on board and manage the party. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it\'s solving a problem they ought never to have had.\n\nA reliable party is a basic for any government that wants to be effective. And it shouldn\'t be an issue for an administration with a huge majority. But you don\'t need me to remind you Labour\'s time in office has been eventful at best, chaotic at worst, with the leadership unable to keep its MPs in line.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the changes to benefits in the Budget gives Labour a clearer identity, an argument in the party\'s comfort zone that it\'s happy to make. From a political point of view, another government source says "there\'ll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight."\n\nIf - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. The hope is that would unlock cash for the economy, despite big tax rises, big increases on welfare spending and the country\'s still whopping debts.\n\nAfter all the preparation (more on the dark side of it later), there was no big meltdown in the markets on the day. Remember, market reaction matters because the government borrows lots and lots of money from investors who want it back one day.\n\nBusiness leaders hope seeming stability hangs around and endless politicking ends. As one says: "Best-case scenario is this gives stability - the government can crack on, and we see an uptick [in the economy]. It\'s not like other governments globally are smashing it."\n\nAnother boss of a company worth billions told me: "Twenty-six billion of extra tax is not normal, but I think the Budget will settle things down. We all love to criticise but maybe it is time to cut them some slack."\n\nThe polls do not suggest for a second that the public at large is in the mood to do that. Early surveys of opinion after the Budget give Reeves\'s plans short shrift. More than a million people will be paying more income tax or paying it for the first time - not a traditional reason for cheer.\n\nInflation is expected to be higher for this year than expected. And the growth in people\'s spending power is predicted to be\n\n. But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario "has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer\'s job is expected to hang in the balance.\n\nThe Budget has not brought that moment of jeopardy any closer, which given how rocky things have been, is a win of sorts. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: "The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge."\n\nWhat about the worst-case scenario?\n\nThe ink on the Budget headlines was barely dry when along came another political fuss about a\n\n. For some in the party, the timing was incomprehensible - one senior figure told me, exasperated: "in terms of managing your party, why do it this week? You\'d calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!"\n\nSeparate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they\'d been unfairly sacked.\n\nFor some in the unions and the party, dropping day-one protection from unfair dismissal was a necessary compromise to make sure the bigger changes to workers\' rights could pass through Parliament. But it has angered some on the left.\n\nA source close to the talks with the unions and business told me "you can\'t grid the negotiations" - in other words, the announcement couldn\'t be fitted into a neat government timetable.\n\nThe partial climbdown is not likely to result in an enormous bust-up – one of Angela Rayner\'s steadfast allies who pioneered the wider plans said they were a "little concerned" rather than frothing with rage. But the spat punctures any suggestion that the Budget will end grumps and strops inside the party.\n\nAnd listen to this warning from another source in the Labour movement: "It\'s a ludicrous thing to have done – it was a clear manifesto pledge. It\'s not complicated and it\'s made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections."\n\nIn other words, leadership watch out.\n\nFor all the political focus, the Budget is of course also a huge economic moment and it simply isn\'t pretty. Debt is still sky-high. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. State spending, particularly on welfare, is going up and up.\n\nIt\'s hard to reconcile that with Reeves and Starmer\'s language before and after the general election: that helping business make money and hire more people - growth - was at the top of their list.\n\nOne city figure told me: "The left side of Labour might hate business but that\'s what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows."\n\nAnother senior business figure told me: "I think we are bit screwed aren\'t we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list."\n\nThe minimum wage is going up. Business rates are going up for many companies. Even one union figure told me "growth\'s gone as a priority".\n\nFor one city insider, there is a sense that Reeves\'s effort to play nice with the business community before the election had been for nothing. "They\'ve sacrificed any opportunity they had to really drive growth, support aspiration and build an economy around thriving businesses and entrepreneurship in favour of saving their jobs. Taxpayers and business have been betrayed and both have long memories.\n\n"All of the pre-election talk about being the party of business and growth was bullshit. Everyone recognises that now and they won\'t forget."\n\nGovernment figures dispute this. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: "If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it\'s quite a good idea those children don\'t go hungry when they are growing up."\n\nStarmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it\'s always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Downing Street insiders suggest it\'s bogus to suggest the new focus on child poverty means they\'re not interested in helping business grow any more.\n\nMultiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values.\n\nOne former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992.\n\nBut in the worst-case scenario, the economy remains on a measly path. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean "everyone will just not hire - there\'s nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it."\n\nThe Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. But the official predictions at the moment do not make for reassuring reading.\n\nLastly, decisions in the Budget might bash the public\'s trust in the government even further.\n\nThat\'s not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party\'s election manifesto. And Reeves also stands\n\nRepeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. put your taxes up.\n\nThis impression was created over many weeks, so tax rises didn\'t come as a massive shock to you or the markets. Some leaks were accidental. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking\n\nHere\'s the rub. What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn\'t actually a hole in her finances after all. The Conservatives have blasted her for "lying" about the numbers. Downing Street has flat-out denied that.\n\nBut even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: "Everyone knows the game, but there\'s a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby."\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face.\n\nBudgets can unravel spectacularly, fall apart before your eyes. That has not happened this week. Given how bad things have been for this government in the last few months, that fact alone will be a relief. And Labour has emerged with a sharper political identity that\'s relieved many in its rank and file. But that\'s not the same as pleasing the public.\n\nThe financial picture doesn\'t give much cheer.

I stand by my analysis. I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron. It is clearly\n\nBurry has repeatedly warned that today\'s AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand.\n\nThe Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron\'s, responded to Burry\'s criticism of Nvidia\'s stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks.\n\n"NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU taxes," the memo said, referring to Restricted Stock Units. "Employee equity grants should not be conflated with the performance of the repurchase program. NVIDIA\'s employee compensation is consistent with that of peers. Employees benefitting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance."\n\nThe memo also disputed Burry\'s claims around depreciation life. To Burry\'s charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia\'s graphics processing units in order to justify runaway capital expenditures, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns.\n\nNvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s, released in 2020, continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics.\n\nThe memo also rejects Burry\'s suggestion of "\n\n," saying Nvidia\'s strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI startups raise capital predominantly from outside investors.\n\nBurry said he believes Nvidia now occupies the same position that Cisco — the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle — held in 1999-2000.\n\nJust as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that "internet traffic doubles every 100 days," today\'s hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter.\n\nThe heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5\n\nof U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry\'s belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity, he said.\n\n"And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it.

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjg92y00no', 'title': "'This is the big one' - tech firms bet on electrifying rail", 'body': 'Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it.\n\n"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels," says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects.\n\n. It\'s small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways.\n\nNot only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. "If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy," he adds.\n\nAround the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with\n\non their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging.\n\nBut engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects.\n\nA key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid –\n\nto a big connection for powering your trains. "That problem has only become much, much worse," says Mr Murray.\n\nThis is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects.\n\nMr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way.\n\nNow, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain,\n\nfor rail-side renewables projects.\n\n"This is the big one," says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.\n\nNew projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system.\n\nBut for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC).\n\nEfforts are underway in England to develop\n\nthat could solve this problem, though.\n\nSeparately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield.\n\nThe software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation.\n\n"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements," says João Pombo, associate director of the university\'s Institute of Railway Research. "All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August."\n\nBut there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system.\n\nonto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets.\n\n"We eliminate locomotives completely," says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. "Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups."\n\nA key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area.\n\nNevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year.\n\nThese will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. "In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first."\n\nIt would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.\n\nIn the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm\'s wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule.\n\nHe describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – "atomised freight", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be\n\n. "We\'re focused on doing the shorter stuff that they\'re not doing," says Mr Soule.\n\nHe adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. "If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we\'ve doubled the rail industry," he says.\n\nStuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be "quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways".\n\nBut he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the "go-to" option for new railways.\n\n"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case," he says.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 18, 505763), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 18, 505763)}

And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power.\n\nIts mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech\'s current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum\n\nfrom tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.\n\nBroadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate.\n\nPut them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that\'s more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word "might" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters.\n\n"The potential is there, but the jury is still out," he says.\n\n"Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI."\n\nIn terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035,\n\nMeanwhile, AI\'s value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles.\n\n"I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged," jokes Mr Hopkins.\n\nIn mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could\n\nwhile mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.\n\nQuantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the "hallucinations" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error.\n\nThese are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them.\n\nIt\'s tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the\n\nQuantum computers don\'t look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big.\n\nThey exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape.\n\nThey require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It\'s not the sort of thing you\'re likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket.\n\nThey\'re also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature.\n\nThe luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world\'s first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020.  And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.\n\nThese machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn\'t stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential.\n\n"We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives," said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC\'s Tech Life podcast.\n\n"The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI."\n\nProf Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK\'s top quantum experts. "Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds," he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4\'s The Life Scientific.\n\nSo what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they\'re ready?\n\nAs with AI, there\'s a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare.\n\nQuantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers.\n\nTo give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world\'s fastest super computers\n\n- or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete.\n\nHazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that\'s most likely to work for you.\n\nAnd that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers.\n\nQuantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks.\n\nIn 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy.\n\n"The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology," said researcher Ryan Hill at the time.\n\n"A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still.\n\n"Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge."\n\nLast year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a "quantum compass", on the city\'s underground Tube network.\n\nGPS doesn\'t work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather.\n\n"The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication," says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK\'s National Quantum Computing Centre.\n\n"Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems."\n\nThe National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what\'s known as "load shedding" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts.\n\nAnd Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.\n\nSo far, so good – but we also need to talk about secrets.\n\nIt is widely accepted that current forms of encryption – the way in which we store both personal data and official secrets – will one day be busted by quantum technology being able to churn through every single possible combination in record time, until the data becomes unscrambled.\n\nNations are known to be already stealing encrypted data from each other with a view to being able to decode it one day.\n\n"It\'s called harvest now, decrypt later," says Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\n"The theory of how to break current forms of public key encryption await a truly operational quantum computer," he adds.\n\n"The threat is so high that it\'s assumed everyone needs to introduce quantum-resistant encryption now."\n\nThe moment a such a computer exists is sometimes referred to as Q-day. Estimates of when it might arrive vary, but Brian Hopkins at Forrester says it could be soon - around the year 2030.\n\nCompanies like Apple and the secure messaging platform Signal have already rolled out what they believe to be post-quantum encryption keys, but they cannot be applied retrospectively to current data encrypted in the traditional way.\n\nAnd that\'s already a problem. In October, Daniel Shiu, the former head of cryptographic design at GCHQ, the UK\'s intelligence, security and cyber agency, told the Sunday Times it was "credible that almost all UK citizens will have had data compromised" in state-sponsored cyber attacks carried out by China – with that data stockpiled for a time when it can be decrypted and studied.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 23, 144908), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 23, 144908)}

I have," says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. "I wouldn\'t recommend it," he adds, however. It\'s very salty, apparently.\n\nBut this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests.\n\n, two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed.\n\nWhat is Burnblock exactly? No-one will say. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock\'s website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is "a natural component in the body" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and "a natural component in some berries".\n\nFlame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries.\n\nBut many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century\n\n. "There hasn\'t been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them," says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US.\n\nWhen you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. "It also releases some water," he adds. "That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire\'s spread." And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. You can add Burnblock to other building materials, he says, including dried seagrass.\n\nHalt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels.\n\n"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire]," says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – "No" is the answer.\n\nIn one of Halt\'s buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. The top one is a tank containing the treatment fluid that I saw earlier. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood\'s pores, says Mr McCann.\n\nThen, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid.\n\n"What that pressure is doing is, it\'s forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber," says Mr McCann.\n\nAfter this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It\'s carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood.\n\n"Timber is an amazing material," says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. He refers to wood\'s ability to take up treatment fluids within its pores. "You can ultimately change the chemistry of its burning behaviour," he says.\n\nHull is often sceptical of new flame retardants, however. He points out that some ideas have come and gone. "There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s," he says. "Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out."\n\nWhile timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains.\n\nDr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, "solid gasoline" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly.\n\nIn Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm\'s solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry.\n\nFirst Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood.\n\nCould graphene affect people\'s health following a fire? A spokeswoman says, "There\'s no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects."\n\nIn the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards.\n\nExperiments suggest that the graphene does reduce the plastic\'s ability to burn. "It hits the highest ratings in those tests," says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer.\n\nBuildings aren\'t just at risk from fires that start inside them, though. "\n\n," says Dr Morgan. That\'s why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage.\n\nProf Appel hopes to test the substance on mini structures, or mock-built homes, soon.\n\nLab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire.\n\n"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, \'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this\'," recalls Prof Appel.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 24, 37833), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 24, 37833)}

They\'re decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nTraditionally advertisers on social media could target people by the demographic segment they were deemed to fit into - for example, if you\'re a student in Edinburgh or a 35-year-old woman who likes yoga. Ads would "follow" you around the internet based on what you\'d been searching.\n\nBut using the ability of AI to draw on vast quantities of data, companies like Cheil UK can create thousands of different ads that are tailored to different personalities and personal situations. The aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them, down to the tone, phrasing, music and colours used.\n\nTo do that Cheil UK has been working with start-up Spotlight on an AI platform. To get extra layers of information they ask large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, lots of questions about a particular brand to find out what people are saying about it on the internet.\n\nFrom those answers they might, for example, be able to create an ad that not only suits a 35-year old woman who likes yoga, but also one that has just been on holiday or was about to get married.\n\n"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level," says Mr Camacho.\n\n"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that\'s when you start to build a picture to understand that individual."\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn\'t mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it\'s still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile," explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University\'s Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done]," he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising \'wastage\' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they\'ve already forgotten it," says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop."\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n"There\'s also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with," says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn\'t whether brands can personalise everything - it\'s whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do."\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n"There\'s going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there\'s going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths," he says.\n\n"And that\'s the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n"We don\'t have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We\'re trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We\'re trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that\'s all we\'ve ever tried to do."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 26, 191691), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 26, 191691)}

It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine.\n\nBefore Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements.\n\nNow, she makes drones for use against the Russians.\n\n"It was just an obvious decision for me," she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. "I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."\n\nMs Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed.\n\n"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones," she recalled. "So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."\n\nThese days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon.\n\nCombat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact.\n\nBefore 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones.\n\n"This has been the first full-blown drone war," says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare.\n\n"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They\'ve become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."\n\nAnd not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power." Ms Pettyjohn says.\n\nThe world\'s biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has\n\nsince Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Europe, Portugal\'s Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany\'s Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due\n\nin Swindon in southwest England at the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be\n\non new military drones.\n\n"The sector is growing really quickly," said Mike Armstrong, Stark\'s managing director for the UK. "I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we\'ve seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."\n\nThe growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down.\n\nAnti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport.\n\nOleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company.\n\n"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones," he says.\n\nSince 2022, DroneShield\'s share price has\n\n"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us," Mr Vornik adds.\n\nAs well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China\'s use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs.\n\nMunin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army.\n\n"We\'re building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones," he says. "It\'s a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it\'s coming in."\n\nExperts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger.\n\nBut Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. "That is going to be the next real shift.\n\n"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."\n\nIn the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line.\n\n"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course," she says. "A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers.\n\n"But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 27, 500878), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 27, 500878)}

But it\'s also the toughest crop a farmer can cultivate," says Stanley Pothan, who has been farming cardamom in the southern Indian state of Kerala for decades.\n\nPrized for centuries for its complex, aromatic flavour, cardamom is fiendishly difficult to grow.\n\n"Cardamom is a very delicate plant - prone to diseases and pest attacks. You have to be constantly in the field, watching every leaf, every flower. It demands attention every single day," says Mr Pothan.\n\nIt\'s also extremely sensitive to weather conditions.\n\n"Last year\'s summer was brutal - we lost a significant portion of our crop to the heat. Guatemala, the world\'s largest cardamom producer, lost almost 60% of its crop that season, and we too suffered badly here in Kerala," he adds.\n\nThat poor harvest contributed to a 70% jump in cardamom prices last year to 1,178 rupees (£10; $13) per kilo, up 70% compared to the previous year, according to figures from India\'s Spice Board.\n\nCardamom has always been expensive, usually the third costliest spice by weight, after saffron and vanilla.\n\nFarmers would be keen to raise their output, but it\'s not easy.\n\n"One bad summer or unexpected rain can wipe away the entire effort. That\'s the harsh reality of cardamom farming," says Mr Pothan.\n\nThe government-funded Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI) is trying to ease the burden of tending to cardamom\'s needs.\n\n"Our focus is on crop improvement, pest and disease surveillance, soil management, capacity building, and technology transfer related to cardamom," says Dr A B Reema, Director of the ICRI, which is part of the government\'s Spices Board of India.\n\nOne of its tools is an app that farmers can use to monitor the health of their soil and gives them tailored recommendations on how to best manage it.\n\n"Technology is no longer separate from farming. It is now a daily tool for cardamom growers, from checking soil health on an app, to monitoring rainfall and disease alerts on their phones," says Dr Reema.\n\n"Even small farmers today are using digital tools. They don\'t have to depend only on local advice, they can check the soil quality, moisture, and even disease symptoms right from their field."\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are looking for hardier cardamom varieties.\n\n"We are mainly focusing on developing cardamom varieties that are tolerant to major diseases and pests, while also being high yielding and climate resilient," says Preity Chetty, assistant professor at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Kerala Agricultural University.\n\nThey have made one breakthrough, by finding a cardamom variety that can grow with limited water.\n\nThe researchers are also delving into the genetic make-up for cardamom to find genetic markers for desirable traits. That knowledge should speed up the breeding of more productive plants.\n\n"Unlike other spices, studies on cardamom are limited, especially at the molecular level. There\'s a lack of molecular markers for reproductive or yield traits, which we are now trying to address," says Dr Chetty.\n\nOne key process in cardamom farming is drying the pods once they have been harvested.\n\nTraditionally only the larger farms could afford to set up their own dryers, often fueled by wood.\n\n"Smaller farmers had to depend on middlemen or neighbours for drying, which often affected the quality," says Annu Sunny, who founded the social enterprise, Graamya, in 2016 to help farmers in Kerala.\n\n"As cardamom is the queen of spices and a cash crop lot of people have started get in to cultivation," she says.\n\n"It\'s a very tricky crop. It takes 10 to 12 years to really understand cardamom, how it behaves, what it needs, when to act and when to wait. Every season is like a new experiment," she adds.\n\nTo help farmers with the drying process, Graayma has introduced heat-pump dryers.\n\nGraayma charges 10 rupees per kilo, which is significantly cheaper than wood drying which cost around 14 rupees per kilo.\n\n"The finish of the product is much better, there\'s no smoke, no uneven heating, and the pods retain their natural green colour. That\'s very important because colour decides the price."\n\nGrowing cardamom with the help of fertilisers and pesticides is hard enough, but some farmers are going a step further, by taking an organic approach to cultivation.\n\n"When I first started, I had no idea what I was getting into," says Mathews Geroge, formerly a banker who turned to farming in Kerala in 2020.\n\n"When I first spoke to scientists at the Cardamom Research Institute, they discouraged me. They said cardamom is too sensitive and difficult to grow organically."\n\nInitially they appeared to be right - around 90% of his first crop was destroyed by pests and local traders rejected his cardamom because, to them, it looked in poor condition.\n\nAfter two years of experimentation he turned to the ancient Indian cultivation methods of Vrikshayurveda, which he says has bought more success. But it\'s still not easy.\n\n"Even today, I wouldn\'t say I\'ve mastered cardamom farming. It\'s still a challenge. Some seasons are good, some aren\'t. But now I understand the rhythm of the crop - when to act, when to wait, when to let nature do its job."\n\nUltimately, Mr Geroge thinks organic farming will be able to compete with traditional methods.\n\n"Sustainable farming begins with reducing input costs. Many farmers think organic means expensive, but if you make your own inputs and understand your soil, you can actually earn better with less dependence on chemicals."\n\nOne aspect of cardamom farming that is unlikely to change soon is the need for skilled workers.\n\nMr Pothan estimates that labour accounts for 75% of his costs and most of that is spent at harvest time.\n\n"Harvesting is a skilled job - mostly done by women. They know exactly which capsule is ready and which isn\'t. They may pluck one or two from a bunch and return to the same plant after 45 days for the next round. That\'s why it\'s so labour-intensive," Mr Pothan says.\n\nMs Sunny says those jobs are likely to be secure.\n\n"Mechanisation in cardamom is limited. You can mechanise spraying or de-weeding, but not pruning or harvesting. Every innovator who visits our farm looks at cardamom and says \'we\'ll solve this\'. But nothing concrete has come out yet."\n\nMr Pothan agrees and adds that cardamom demands more than just good process.\n\n"In cardamom, there\'s no shortcut. You can\'t automate everything. It\'s one of those crops that needs both science and soul."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 28, 385017), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 28, 385017)}

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.\n\nCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.\n\nIt is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.\n\nHe admits that in the past few months "there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here".\n\nThis conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.\n\nTo get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.\n\nBack in September, local protestors angry at what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process to replace Consettur blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.\n\nThis resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.\n\nA number of local people, who didn\'t want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.\n\nAlthough Consettur\'s licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.\n\nIt\'s a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\n\n"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here," he says. "This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."\n\nThese partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.\n\nMeanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.\n\nAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.\n\nSpeaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: "We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."\n\nHer friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site "was a nightmare for us". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren\'t doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.\n\nThe mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\n\n"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."\n\nHe wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.\n\nOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that "more needs to be done for the local communities".\n\nShe adds: "We don\'t have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."\n\nCarlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\n\n"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country," he says. "If we don\'t have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can\'t be competitive in the long term."\n\nHe also wants to change tourists\' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\n\n"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area," says Mr Gonzalez. "And let\'s not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."\n\nBut he says that Peru\'s unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\n\n"I\'ve been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."\n\nBack in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he\'d be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\n\n"If they are given the final approval we don\'t have a problem with working with them. We won\'t stop them."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 29, 964556), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 29, 964556)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewj1e1yk2vo', 'title': 'Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?', 'body': 'Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time.\n\nWhen his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires.\n\nThere was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off.\n\nThen in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed.\n\n"We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre," says Mr Jiménez. "Then the town grew and passed us by."\n\nFuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo\'s population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022,\n\nIn addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night.\n\nThis has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through.\n\nLast year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez\'s workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.\n\nAñelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn\'t until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.\n\nFracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.\n\nThe first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina\'s majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.\n\nBy February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.\n\nThis accounts "for more than half of Argentina\'s oil and gas production", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.\n\nHe adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.\n\nNicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. "We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin," he says. "All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."\n\nThe oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.\n\n"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn]," says Mr Gadano. "This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."\n\nMr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports "is very important" for the country, "especially when two or three years ago we were in the red". Yet he adds that it won\'t be "the panacea" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.\n\n"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy," he says.\n\n"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."\n\nOther commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina\'s bad credit rating is putting off international investors.\n\nThey also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.\n\n"Companies say \'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven\'t been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force\'," explains Mr Gadano. "That\'s not how the world works, that\'s not how companies work, especially the big international players."\n\nThe government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party\'s victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.\n\nOther critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.\n\nGustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government "is doing what it has to do and what it can do".\n\nWhat continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. "All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow," notes Mr Gadano.\n\nThis consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.\n\n"We are really losing in the public debate," says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. "There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."\n\nBack at Mr Jiménez\'s garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. "When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."\n\nYet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country\'s problems. "Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 32, 760317), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 32, 760317)}

It may affect production and exports of the country\'s famous feta cheese.\n\nAnastasia Siourtou walks through her deserted farm on the outskirts of Karditsa, a city in the Thessaly region of central Greece.\n\nAn eerie silence hangs over the place where 650 sheep were being raised.\n\nOn 12 November veterinary officials culled all the livestock after a case of sheep and goat pox was detected.\n\n"There is another farm two kilometres away. They had pox cases, but hid it," she says, alluding to how she believes her herd contracted the disease.\n\nMs Siourtou is a veterinarian herself and has expanded the farm that her father built.\n\nLosing the animals means financial ruin - besides the livestock the farm lost, the sheep\'s milk, which is sold for the production of feta cheese, is often referred to as Greece\'s "white gold".\n\nMore than the financial blow, however, Ms Siourtou speaks of the emotional toll. "I was here the day the sheep were culled. It is very cruel, I felt that I failed to protect them."\n\nSheep and goat pox is a viral infection. The first cases were detected in northern Greece in August 2024, and the disease has since spread across many regions of the country.\n\nA total of 1,702 incidents had been recorded by mid-November, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.\n\nDetecting a single case on a farm means the entire herd must be culled for preventive reasons. Some 417,000 sheep and goats have been disposed of so far, which is roughly 4-5% of the previous total.\n\nApproximately 80% of Greek sheep and goat\'s milk\n\nwithin the European Union.\n\nThis means that while similar cheese can be produced elsewhere in the EU it cannot be called feta. The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.\n\nLast year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.\n\nFeta has to be made of at least 70% sheep\'s milk, with the remainder being goat\'s.\n\nSmall dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep\'s milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.\n\n"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market," says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.\n\nAnother sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.\n\nHe now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. "The shop is closed," he says bitterly.\n\nMr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. "I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.\n\n"The day they were culled, I was here. If you cut me that day, I wouldn\'t bleed."\n\nHe is flipping thoughtfully through a government document packed with numerical tables.\n\nAffected farmers are being offered compensation of between €132 and €220 per sheep depending on its age. Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.\n\nMeanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.\n\nAt the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: "We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.\n\n"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases."\n\nGreece\'s Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.\n\nAcross the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.\n\nThe BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.\n\nThe owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. "Some animals have lumps on their chest. It\'s not pox, but no one will believe me," he says.\n\nSheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\nSuch vaccination is allowed in an emergency\n\nand farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission\'s available stock.\n\nHowever, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat\'s milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.\n\nProf Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but "are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]". "They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations."\n\nYet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.\n\nMembers of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.\n\nBut many livestock farmers are angry with the officials\' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.\n\nFarmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.\n\nIt was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.\n\n"It\'s extremely harsh," he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.\n\nThere are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.\n\nMr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. "I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves," he says.

The problem is there is some political pressure to do just that.\n\nOne of the points of tension was the refusal of Mr Hughes to give credit to the government for "pro-growth" policies.\n\nHe had said he would not score any policy unless it was material in its impact on the economy. In the event, none reached the 0.1% of national income threshold.\n\nIt is a careful balancing act, however.\n\nAny perceived interference with the OBR\'s independence could affect market credibility too, and, for example, raise UK government borrowing costs.\n\nWhen I saw the now-departing chairman on the evening of the Budget last week, he was clearly mortified by the responsibility of his organisation\n\nWhile it is no surprise to me that Mr Hughes took the honourable decision to resign for an error identified as the fault of a junior member of staff, it was not the only issue vexing him.\n\nHe was a fierce defender of the independence of his organisation from political and ministerial pressure - from right and left. That was seen during the Liz Truss mini budget episode, and in recent weeks too.\n\nThere had been a drumbeat of noise from the right and the left, and now from the centre too, about the\n\nof elected governments.\n\nThe OBR was in some corners seen as an arm of a "woke deep state", and by others as an "agent of austerity".\n\nThere had, however, been tension over the Budget.\n\nChanges had already been planned. The chancellor had also announced that she would only respond to the OBR\'s forecasts once a year.\n\nMr Hughes told me: "We\'ll still be producing two full economic and fiscal forecasts looking five years out, twice a year, now and in the spring.\n\n"But with this change of legislation, the government doesn\'t feel obliged to respond to those forecasts with policy in the spring.  It\'ll be more like a health check on the economy and the public finances.\n\n"There\'ll be no loss of transparency from the forecast documentation that we\'ll produce."\n\nThe precise design of the new approach to the OBR\'s forecast will matter. If there is a marked improvement in the public finances in spring, will the chancellor really avoid spending any "surplus" ahead of crucial local elections?\n\nAround the Budget, the OBR scored an improvement to the UK economy as a result of the use of AI by the end of the decade. The OBR also used new powers to initiate a tricky costing for the ballooning cost of special educational needs in England, inviting a backlash from some Cabinet ministers.\n\nFor some this underscores its ability, like no campaign or Cabinet minister initiative, to focus government priorities. Mr Hughes denied the 35-member forecasting group was too powerful.\n\n"The powers given to us are those given to us by Parliament in an Act of Parliament, and that\'s to produce a forecast. Chancellors set their own targets. They set their own policies. Chancellors are in charge of £1.5 trillion worth of revenue and £1.5 trillion worth of spending," he told me.\n\n"If they don\'t want to meet their targets, they can change them, which we\'ve seen chancellors do in the past as well.\n\n"All we do is produce a baseline forecast, cost government policies when they give them to us, and we give them an assessment about whether we\'re up there, in line and on track to meet those targets."\n\nIn terms of the government\'s difficulties over the run up to this Budget, Mr Hughes may also take some important details of the timing of various claims around the state of the public finances to his gardening leave.\n\nHe had been due to address the Treasury Select Committee this morning, that has now been cancelled. He recognised the publication of his clarification table on Friday of the evolution of the forecasts was unusual.\n\nOver five years at the OBR Richard Hughes faced five chancellors, and his relationship with all of them was designed to help promote UK economic stability.\n\nThe new relationship with a different OBR is an opportunity for the government, but a big risk too.\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 35, 253496), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 35, 253496)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze60epnde0o', 'title': "Why time is running out for Germany's green hydrogen industry", 'body': 'In a spotless, hushed factory near Hamburg in northern Germany, industrial robots stand ready to assemble the components of electrolysers.\n\nThese devices split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The ones manufactured by Quest One use proton exchange membranes to accomplish this.\n\nThe robotic arms crafting Quest One\'s electrolysers are faster and more reliable than the humans they\'ve replaced.\n\nBut that speed and efficiency is not fully needed yet, as the order volume for electrolysers is far below the facility\'s capacity.\n\nThe mismatch between supply and demand is evident from Quest One\'s own staffing.\n\nThis Hamburg plant can support almost double the current staff. But earlier this year, the company had to lay off 20% of its workforce in Germany.\n\n"The market itself is not picking up organically," acknowledges Nima Pegemanyfar, Quest One\'s executive vice president for customer operations. "Demand is the problem. It\'s not supply."\n\nDemand is sluggish in part because green hydrogen – hydrogen produced via electrolysis, using renewable electricity – remains pricey compared to the fossil fuels used to make other types of hydrogen.\n\nLow-emissions hydrogen production makes up less than 1% of hydrogen production globally. This includes both green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas with the resulting carbon dioxide captured and stored.\n\nScaling up would help bring down the costs of green hydrogen, but many projects remain small-scale.\n\nQuest One is hoping that production of green hydrogen will eventually cost €4 ($4.60; £3.50) per kilogram – about half of the current price in Germany, according to the company.\n\nThe gap is not only between supply and demand.\n\nThere may also be a disconnect between the sectors where green hydrogen is most badly needed (for instance, for high-temperature uses in the chemical, steel and shipping industries) and the use cases that are less competitive, but still generate chatter.\n\nChristian Stöcker, a communication professor at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, is frustrated at the attention paid to hydrogen for heating buildings and powering cars. These would be extremely inefficient, he points out, in comparison to heat pumps and electrification.\n\nProf Stöcker is also concerned about green hydrogen\'s links to fossil fuel companies and automakers. Some critics argue that these companies have an interest in finding uses for, or justifying, fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nQuest One is part of the Volkswagen Group, which reportedly is considering selling the company it owns (Everllence) that in turn owns Quest One.\n\nVolkswagen would not confirm or deny this to the BBC, or specify whether it had any other plans related to green hydrogen. A spokesperson states, "We are currently reviewing strategic options for Everllence."\n\nMaking prices more competitive will depend on government policy, German green hydrogen companies say. Other than regulation supporting this sector, there\'s no plan B.\n\nAnd then all the infrastructure and investment will stand wasted.\n\nThat infrastructure includes a network of hydrogen pipelines planned for northern Germany, snaking out from the Port of Hamburg to a number of hydrogen producers and – it is hoped – industrial clients.\n\nThe infrastructure also includes salt caverns to store hydrogen underground, which Storengy Deutschland is building around an existing site for storing natural gas in Lower Saxony.\n\nThe company believes that the best way to store excess renewable electricity is to convert it into hydrogen, store it at least 1,000 metres underground, then use it in winter when the need is greatest.\n\nIt\'s a long and costly process, and regular operations wouldn\'t start until the 2030s at the earliest.\n\nAlso being planned, for greater supply, are hydrogen transport networks between Germany and places as distant as India, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Namibia.\n\nHydrogen gas can be converted into ammonia and then transported as a liquid. However, there are efficiency losses, including when extracting the hydrogen on the receiving end.\n\nThere are also criticisms of the potential carving up of ecologically or culturally significant locations abroad to feed European industries. This could exacerbate the gap in energy access between the countries supplying and consuming hydrogen.\n\nThe German government has stated that hydrogen is necessary for reaching climate targets. But amid high costs it is loosening its ambitions for green hydrogen.\n\nYet many green hydrogen companies in Germany are calling for more government support to domestic industries and energy stability in competition with China, the world\'s powerhouse of green hydrogen production.\n\nChinese companies account for almost 60% of the world\'s capacity to manufacture electrolysers.\n\nOverall, Ivana Jemelkova, CEO of the industry group Hydrogen Council, admits that demand for green hydrogen is not in line with the very high expectations of five years ago.\n\nIn the last 18 months, 52 low-carbon and renewable hydrogen projects were cancelled, she says. "That\'s a lot of bad news."\n\nThe project cancellations, delays and bankruptcies continue to mount.\n\nFor instance, in May 2025, the Norwegian renewable energy company Statkraft decided to stop developing new green hydrogen projects, due to market uncertainty. A spokesperson says that the company will focus on fewer technologies going forward.\n\nBut "while some of the individual trees may be falling…the forest, as such, is really growing," Ms Jemelkova believes. "It\'s not hype anymore. But it\'s not doom and gloom."\n\nFor the German companies standing ready to produce, store and move green hydrogen, it\'s now crunch time. They can\'t wait any longer for a supportive market, some say.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 37, 625666), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 37, 625666)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjekjkx2gpno', 'title': 'How family firms can best plan for succession', 'body': 'When Rupert Murdoch and his children finally reached a deal earlier this year to end the years-long succession battle over the media mogul\'s empire, the high-profile saga offered a valuable lesson for every family-run company.\n\nThe clear message was that such firms need a thorough plan in place for how the business is handed over to the next generation, or else they could be mired in emotional and legal drama.\n\nHere three family-owned and run companies, from both sides of the Atlantic, reveal how they have approached the succession issue.\n\nBiscuit-maker Walker\'s Shortbread is one of Scotland\'s largest food exporters, with its tartan-coloured tins and packets a regular sight at supermarkets and airports around the world.\n\nIt was founded back in 1898 by Joseph Walker, and today his great-grandson Nicky Walker holds the top managing director position.\n\nMr Walker says the business operates what it calls a "cousins consortium" model.\n\nWhat this means, he explains, is that all members of the extended Walker family, and especially their children, are encouraged to join the business. And each is allowed to have a say on where they would ideally position themselves in a managerial role.\n\n"Our succession plan essentially says that if you want to come into the business, there\'s a role for you here," says Mr Walker. "And since the company\'s expanding, there\'s a whole career to be formed and honed here."\n\nHe adds that when "points of contention" do come up, the aim is always to reach a consensus. "We have always reached decisions based on what is best for the company… with the firm understanding that the business always comes first.\n\n"With the understanding that a unity of voice is of paramount importance, an acceptable outcome has always been achieved."\n\nThe company is also not averse to bringing in external experts, such as engaging with professional advisors on the formal, legal accept of succession planning, and the formation of an executive board with directors who are not family members.\n\nBuilding a succession plan to bridge the gap between the skills in a business today and those needed tomorrow is critical for family businesses, says Charlie Grubb, a senior managing director at global recruitment company Robert Half.\n\n"Emotional and personal dynamics can be a real challenge for family businesses when it comes to succession planning. There\'s a skill in being able to take that emotional family tie out of the decision-making process, and recognise there are family and leadership roles, and those might be quite different from each other."\n\nBut too often, companies fail to look ahead. More than four in 10 business leaders haven\'t identified someone to take over their role when they decide to move on,\n\nin Canada this year by Robert Half.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate\n\nfound that a lack of succession planning "could lead to increased business closures, job losses, and economic uncertainty".\n\nMike Bronner is boss of California-based Dr Bronner\'s, well known in the US for its soaps, lotions and toothpaste. His grandfather Emanuel Bronner, who founded the business in 1948, didn\'t set up any paperwork for how it should be operated when he had to step away in the 1990s due to declining health.\n\nEmanuel Bronner, who died in 1997, also ran afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, and left the family firm with a $2m (£1.5m) tax bill.\n\n"We learned from that," says Mike Bronner. "And ever since we began thinking about the next generation, and how to ensure that two generations down the line we are still going to function with the same values we have today."\n\nAs for his own succession plan, Mr Bonner says he\'s seeing signs his children are interested in running the company. "My son Eli said he wants to be CEO and I asked him why, and he said, \'Well, I love the mission and the free lunches\'."\n\nWhat helps with succession planning is involving children early in the business. At St James Town Steak and Chops, a butchers and delicatessen in downtown Toronto, owner Mark Michelin has been training his two children, Noah and Alex, both in their mid-20s, to captain the 54-year-old family-run ship once he retires.\n\n"It\'s best for us to have the business stay in the family," says Mr Michelin. "And that blood bond is something our customers appreciate, too.\n\n"They often say to me, \'Oh wow, this is a third-generation family business, and I loved how your dad gave me some deli meats for free when we came in as kids\'."\n\nBack in the Scottish village of Aberlour, Nicky Walker says he firmly believes "that owning and managing a generational family business is an unbelievable privilege. And to have the opportunity to lay the foundations to be succeeded by our own family is fantastic but should never be taken for granted.\n\n"The advice I would give, from my own journey, is that the full support and the great deal of guidance and nurturing I was offered was exceptional. And it is now incumbent upon myself and my generation to, in turn, offer the same, to the next generation.\n\n"We need to offer them unequivocal support, and that is a message I would pass, with respect, to any family business."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 38, 652951), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 38, 652951)}

Prediction markets have their minds made up, but the front-runner also is playing it coy.\n\nWhile that part of the mystery appears ready to clear up in the coming weeks, what\'s far less certain is the type of environment the new central bank leader will face at a potential crossroads for the U.S. economy.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been dubbed the clear favorite, buoyed by a Bloomberg News report last week that handicapped the five-person race to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term runs out in May.\n\nAsked Sunday about the situation, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, "I know who I am going to pick, yeah. We\'ll be announcing it." Beyond that, he smirked when asked about Hassett, adding "I\'m not telling you, we\'ll be announcing it."\n\nThe candidate himself made the rounds on the weekend talk circuit, also dodging questions about his prospects. Hassett is\n\nthat also includes current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder.\n\n"I\'m really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates," Hassett said Sunday on CBS\' "Face the Nation." He did note that markets had a positive reaction to the report of him emerging as the favorite, saying that Americans "could expect President Trump to pick somebody who\'s going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates."\n\nShortly before that, on Fox News, Hassett merely stated, "If he picks me, I\'d be happy to serve."\n\nPredictions markets have been off to the races in recent days, placing firm odds on Hassett getting the job. As of Monday afternoon,\n\ntraders assigned a 79% probability, while\n\nput the chance at 75% and\n\nhad it at just 63%, with "no announcement by Christmas" having the second-highest probability of 22%, easily topping any of the other four finalists.\n\nWhomever the actual pick is will take over a Fed that is\n\nofficials who think additional interest rate cuts are warranted to head off potential trouble in the labor market against those who worry that inflation continues to pose a threat that would be exacerbated by further easing in monetary policy.\n\nFor the next rate decision on Dec. 10, futures market traders are assigning an 87.6% chance of a cut in trading that has been highly volatile in recent weeks.\n\nTrump and other administration officials have been vocal about their preference for much lower rates, and the president has stated that is a litmus test for the next chair. In 2026, members of the rotating cast of regional presidents who get a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee will have a hawkish tilt, meaning a preference to fight inflation and hold rates steady.\n\nBut the coming Fed regime will be about more than rates.\n\n, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the Fed chair search, said he favors a rethink of the Fed\'s mission.\n\n"We\'ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it\'s more than just cutting rates," he said. "I think we\'ve got to kind of simplify things."\n\nIn particular, Bessent singled out the role of regional presidents.\n\nWhile they play a relatively limited role — at least compared to the chair and the Board of Governors — in setting rates and other issues related to monetary policy, public commentary from the local leaders can move markets at times.\n\nBessent said that is part of broader issues related to outsized role the Fed has grown to play in the economy and financial markets, largely since the financial crisis when the central bank played a pivotal role in implementing programs to guide the economy out of its worst slide since the Great Depression.\n\n"I think it\'s time for the Fed just to move back into the background like it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people, set monetary policy on a good course," he said. "All these speeches by these bank presidents ... are just redundant. Why don\'t they actually just come out and talk about the meaningful issues to the American people, rather than the short term view of the next meeting?"\n\nThe view on regional presidents is important in that they come up for reappointment in 2026. While the local boards hire the presidents, they are subject to the Board of Governors\' approval. One issue Bessent also commented on was that several presidents are not from the districts they represent.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, applauded Bessent\'s view.\n\n"We don\'t need a play-by-play Fed," El-Erian said Monday morning on CNBC. "We need the Fed to cool it. We need the Fed to step back and take a bigger, sort of visionary view. And we need reforms. We desperately need reforms. And I think all five on the short list are committed to reforming that institution, which is critical, not just for the U.S. but for the global economy."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 39, 383992), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 39, 383992)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7vdvl2531o', 'title': "'Carspreading' is on the rise - and not everyone is happy about it", 'body': 'Paris is renowned for many things. Its monuments, such as the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. Its broad, leafy avenues and boulevards, its museums and art galleries, its fine cuisine. And its truly appalling traffic.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the city authorities have been trying to tackle the problem, by introducing low-traffic and low-emission zones, by promoting public transport and cycling – and most recently by clamping down on big cars.\n\nIn October 2024 on-street parking charges for visiting "heavy" vehicles were trebled following a public vote, taking them from €6 (£5.20) to €18 (£15.70) for a one-hour stay in the centre, and from €75 (£65) to €225 (£196) for six hours.\n\n"The larger it is, the more it pollutes," said the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, before the vote. The new restrictions, she claimed, would "accelerate the environmental transition, in which we are tackling air pollution".\n\nA few months later, the town hall claimed the number of very heavy cars parking on the city streets had fallen by two-thirds.\n\nCities elsewhere are taking note, including in the UK. Cardiff council has already decided to increase the cost of parking permits for cars weighing more than 2,400kg (5,290lb) - the equivalent of roughly two Ford Fiestas.\n\nThe Labour-controlled authority said, "These heavier vehicles typically produce more emissions, cause greater wear and tear on roads, and critically pose a significantly higher risk in the event of a road traffic collision."\n\nTo begin with, the higher charges will only apply to a small minority of vehicle models, but Cardiff plans to lower the weight threshold over time. Other local authorities are mulling similar steps.\n\nBut many owners say they are reliant on big cars.\n\nMatt Mansell, a father of three based in Guildford, runs a technology company, as well as a property development business, and says he needs his Land Rover Defender 110 for ferrying around clients and children.\n\n"I need to have enough space to put children in, with all of their kit - also, you can fit a door or a three-metre length of pipe in it," he says.\n\n"It\'s very much a utility vehicle, but it\'s presentable."\n\nThere is no question cars in the UK and Europe have been getting bigger over the years. Since 2018, the average width of new models on sale here has risen from 182cm (5.97ft) to 187.5cm (6.15ft), according to data from Thatcham Research – an organisation that evaluates new cars on behalf of the insurance industry.\n\nThe average weight, meanwhile, has increased from 1,365kg (3,000lb) to 1,592kg (3,500lb) over the same period.\n\nThis is not just a recent phenomenon. Data compiled by the International Council for Clean Transportation shows the average width of cars on European markets grew by nearly 10cm (3.9in) between 2001 and 2020. Length increased by more than 19cm (7.4in).\n\nSome critics argue this is a worrying trend, because there simply isn\'t enough room on Britain\'s crowded, often narrow roads or in town centres.\n\nThe standard minimum width of an on-street parking space is 1.8m (5.9ft) in many places. But figures published by T&E, a green transport campaign group, suggest that by the first half of 2023, more than half of the 100 top-selling cars in the UK were fractionally wider than this.\n\nThen there is the rocketing popularity of Sports Utility Vehicles, or SUVs, cars that are at least loosely based on off-road vehicles, although in many cases the resemblance is cosmetic, and they lack genuine off-road features such as four-wheel drive.\n\nThe vast majority will never stray far from the tarmac, hence their rather derisory nickname: Chelsea tractors.\n\nThere are plenty of different designs out there, including utility models that you can actually use off road, swanky status symbols and legions of suburban family wagons.\n\nWhat they all they have in common, however, is size. Even the smaller "crossover" versions, more closely related to conventional cars, tend to be taller and wider than traditional saloons, hatchbacks or estates.\n\nBack in 2011, SUVs made up 13.2% of the market across 27 European countries, according to the automotive research company Dataforce GmbH. By 2025, their market share had grown to 59%.\n\nRachel Burgess, editor of Autocar magazine, believes it is their size that makes them so popular. "Everyone I\'ve spoken to over the years who has bought an SUV says they like being higher up, they like better visibility, and they feel safer on motorways and bigger roads.\n\n"It\'s often better for people with kids to get them in and out of the car with that extra height; and also, for people who are less mobile, it\'s much easier to get in and out of an SUV than a lower hatchback or saloon."\n\nLucia Barbato, from West Sussex, says her second-hand Lexus RX450 SUV - a hybrid model - is vital for transporting her large family in an area with limited public transport. She runs a marketing agency from home and drives her three sons to the bus stop each day, so they can go to school.\n\n"On a Monday morning with three boys, three school bags, three sports kits, and a trumpet thrown in the boot there isn\'t even room in the car for the dog!"\n\nThe popularity of SUVs doesn\'t just apply to mass-market carmakers. Porsche is famous for its sleek sports cars but the Cayenne SUV and the Macan crossover are its bestselling models.\n\nBentley\'s Bentayga SUV accounted for 44% of its sales last year, while Lamborghini is increasingly reliant on its four-wheel drive Urus.\n\nPut bluntly, consumers clearly love SUVs. Carmakers, meanwhile, are only too happy to meet that demand, because building bigger cars can be more profitable, argues David Leggett, editor of industry intelligence website Just Auto.\n\n"Profit margins are generally much higher on larger cars with higher price points. This is largely due to the laws of economics in manufacturing."\n\nThere are, he points out, fundamental costs involved in building any car - for example operating a factory, design work, and the price of the main components.\n\nBut he explains that with small cars, these costs can make up a higher proportion of the selling price.\n\nDaniele Ministeri, senior consultant at JATO Dynamics, points out that many SUVs are closely related to conventional cars, and use the same basic structures.\n\n"For some models, the main differences are limited to factors such as body style, suspension and seating position, allowing them to command an SUV premium price, without comparable cost increases", he says.\n\nEven conventional cars have been getting bigger in some cases.\n\nTake the current VW Golf hatchback, which is 18cm (7in) wider and 26cm (10.2in) longer than the original version introduced in the 1970s. It is also several hundred kilograms heavier.\n\n"If we look back to the early 2000s… safety programmes like Euro NCAP were just starting to deliver the safety message to consumers, smaller vehicles weren\'t really able to absorb the energy of a crash very well at all," says Alex Thompson, principal safety engineer at Thatcham Research.\n\n"As safety measures have improved, a certain amount of weight had to be added on to vehicles to strengthen up safety compartments because they weren\'t that strong back then."\n\n"Manufacturers have had to do things like improve structural crash protection, and fit more airbags," agrees David Leggett.\n\n"At the same time, they want to improve interior cabin space and put more features into vehicles, so the net result is rising pressure for bigger vehicle dimensions."\n\nYet while bigger cars may be safer for their occupants, critics insist they are considerably less safe for other road users.\n\n"Whether you\'re in another car [or] a pedestrian, you\'re more likely to be seriously injured if there\'s a collision with one of these vehicles," argues Tim Dexter, vehicles policy manager at T&E. He is also concerned about the implications for cyclists.\n\nResearch carried out in 2023 by Belgium\'s Vias Institute, which aims to improve road safety, suggested that a 10cm (3.9in) increase in the height of a car bonnet could increase the risk of vulnerable road users being killed in a collision by 27%. T&E also highlights concerns that high bonnets can create blind spots.\n\nAlex Thompson says that taller, higher cars are more likely to harm pedestrians and cyclists, although he emphasises that vehicle design in recent years has "really prioritised" protecting vulnerable road users.\n\nSome manufacturers have, for example, fitted external airbags to their vehicles.\n\nAs for the environmental impact, the International Energy Agency has said: "Despite advances in fuel efficiency and electrification, the trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs, which emit roughly 20% more emissions than an average medium-sized car, has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world\'s passenger car fleet in recent decades."\n\nThe move towards electric vehicles should at least mitigate emissions from daily use significantly over time, although if the electricity they use is generated from fossil sources such as gas, bigger cars may well still pollute more per vehicle than smaller ones.\n\nAnd other concerns about size and weight will still apply – in fact, with electric cars generally weighing considerably more than their petrol or diesel equivalents, certain problems could be magnified.\n\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says that 40% of SUVs are now zero-emission.\n\nIts chief executive, Mike Hawes, has previously said that overall the carbon dioxide emissions of new SUVs have more than halved since 2000, "helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility".\n\nBut if there is to be a clampdown, one option is what has already been done across the Channel.\n\nFrance already imposes extra registration taxes on cars that weigh in at more than 1,600kg (3,527lb). Currently, this means a €10 (£8.70) penalty for every extra kilogramme. The penalty increases in bands, reaching €30 (£26.20) per kg above 2,100kg (4,629lb).\n\nWhile it only applies to a relatively small proportion of current models – and electric vehicles are excluded – it sits alongside significant emissions-based penalties. Together this can add up to €70,000 (£61,160) to the cost of buying a new car.\n\nT&E argues that a similar levy should be introduced in the UK. According to Tim Dexter, "At the moment the UK is a tax haven for these large vehicles… We know the impact they are having on the road, on communities, potentially on individuals. It\'s only fair they should be paying a bit more."\n\nDavid Leggett believes people could potentially be encouraged to buy smaller vehicles, particularly for use in cities. "There are opportunities to tweak tax regimes to make smaller cars relatively attractive," he says.\n\nBut ensuring there are enough runabouts to go around may be tricky.

They will be joined before long by Kia\'s EV2, and VW\'s ID Polo.\n\nFor the moment though, SUVs remain firmly in charge.\n\n"Clearly, people want SUVs, and I\'m not sure what the answer to that is," says Rachel Burgess.

It\'s the latest sign the prediction market company is deepening its push to win over the same cryptocurrency holders that have pumped billions of dollars of digital assets into its rival Polymarket.\n\nTokenization refers to creating a digital version of a real-world financial asset such as a stock, bond or treasury note. The resulting token, which can be held or traded like a normal asset, lives on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain, such as Solana or Bitcoin.\n\nThe tokenized versions of the contracts work the same way as the regular ones found previously on Kalshi\'s platform. However, by trading the tokens instead of the actual contracts, users have more anonymity. This puts Kalshi on par with Polymarket, which allows users to trade directly on-chain.\n\nSupport for tokenized wagers linked to Kalshi\'s event contracts is live on Solana, Kalshi told CNBC.\n\nDecentralized finance protocols DFlow and Jupiter will serve as institutional clients, bridging the exchange\'s off-chain orderbook to Solana\'s liquidity.\n\nKalshi is doubling down on its push to court crypto holders as demand for event contracts surges. Prediction markets\' combined trading volume hit nearly $28 billion through October of this year, hitting a weekly record high of $2.3 billion during the week of October 20, according to data\n\nBy tapping into the $3 trillion digital asset market, Kalshi will be able to shore up liquidity needed to scale its offerings at a time when investors\' appetites for prediction markets is growing rapidly, John Wang, the company\'s head of crypto, told CNBC.\n\n"There\'s a lot of power users in crypto," Wang said. "This is about tapping into the billions of dollars of liquidity that crypto has, and then also enabling developers to build third party front ends that utilize Kalshi\'s liquidity."\n\nFounded in 2018, Kalshi was the first exchange to launch federally regulated event contracts on U.S. congressional races for American traders in late 2024, shortly after winning a years-long legal battle against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nSince then, Kalshi has added more event contracts to its platform, running about 3,500 markets, according to a company representative. Last fall, it\n\nat a $5 billion valuation in a funding round backed by crypto heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, in addition to expanding its footprint to more than 140 countries.\n\nBut, it\'s first-mover advantage may not be enough to keep the platform competitive, particularly as Polymarket relaunches in the U.S. Kalshi will need to continue to grow to edge out its rivals, and it will need ample liquidity to do so – something crypto-native traders\' funds could provide, according to Wang.\n\nDigital asset holders tend to be particularly active on prediction markets, trading at higher volumes compared to their non-crypto peers, meaning their presence on the platform is likely to meaningfully boost liquidity across Kalshi\'s markets, the executive said. And by tapping into that massive liquidity, Kalshi can ensure competitive and accurate pricing across its platform, he added.\n\n"If you have a market with no liquidity, then you don\'t really have a market," Wang said.

The more appropriate term would be vacuum-puffing, he notes.\n\nStill, these unique candies have to go through a cold process in the beginning. They\'re subjected to very low temperatures to freeze the internal moisture into solid ice crystals, and then they are moved to a vacuum chamber.\n\n"When the candies dry, the air bubbles cause an expansion, which is why you see gummies turn from soft to hard," Prof Hartel explains.\n\nAnother manufacturer equates the process to "creating our own weather system in these massive chambers," says Claudia Goldfarb, CEO of Sow Good in Texas.\n\n"When the product reaches what we call the glass transition point, the ice crystals within the candy shift from ice to vapour at the speed of sound," Ms Goldfarb adds.\n\nWithout that moisture, the candy turns into a crispy structure with an interior texture that resembles a chocolate malted ball.\n\nAlso, because moisture is removed from the end product, the flavour can be more intense.\n\n"Imagine you were making lemonade and you decided to remove the water, and you were left with sugar and lemons," Ms Goldfarb points out.\n\nNot all candies are suitable for the freeze-dried process, she says.\n\nA Tic Tac or jellybean, for example, does not have enough water and too few air bubbles to allow it to expand. Meanwhile, chocolate melts too quickly under any heating application.\n\nThree years ago, Prof Hartel noticed more small players competing for a share of the freeze-dried candy market, but now larger brands, such as Hershey, want in on the viral trend.\n\n"I wonder if the more independent businesses won\'t be able to compete," he says.\n\nFor Ms Goldfarb and Mr Barlett, when the sizable corporations take notice, the crowded shelves adds more validation to what they do.\n\n"It\'s hopeful to see big-brand adoption after we do something so unprecedented," says Mr Barlett, "and I can see us taking on these brands by continuing to innovate, by not being satisfied with the status quo."\n\nProf Hartel, who teaches candy science to his students, wonders if freeze-dried candy "will just be a fad, but you never know if long-time customers will continue to come back to a type of sweet they didn\'t really enjoy when it was chewy."\n\nBut for passionate fans of this brittle candy, there\'s one pitfall.\n\nMuch like crisps and crackers, the packaging is crucial. "If there\'s a barrier for me when it comes to this candy, it\'s that they are often crushed in the bag due to how fragile they are," says Ms West. "Also, they can be expensive."\n\nMs Goldfarb is bullish on the future for her company and their competitors. "People want innovation in candy, and they want to try something fun and novel," she says, "and that really resonates with consumers."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 41, 142632), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 41, 142632)}

The Biden administration had estimated that its rules would save car-owners roughly $600 on fuel over the life of their vehicles.\n\nKathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the new plan would only benefit the oil industry.\n\n"Gutting fuel economy under the pretense of safety and affordability is a cruel joke for American drivers," she said.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 43, 893989), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 43, 893989)}

I tried to call them but it went to voicemail."\n\nShe met the police officer at her house, where he delivered the worst possible news.\n\nClaire was told there had been ice on the road, and thought it must have been a tragic accident.\n\nSue was a former children\'s nurse whom Claire describes as a "very warm person".\n\nTom was an accountant, a "very clever man", who liked to help other people. He was about to retire. More than 300 people attended the couple\'s funeral.\n\nThe police investigation revealed Gunn had driven the BMW he had recently bought at 87mph shortly before the crash, on the 60mph limit Thurnham Lane, in the village of Bearsted in Kent.\n\nHe had denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty following a trial.\n\nFor Claire, the sentence brought "a sense of relief". However, she also feels "a pain that\'s always there".\n\n"Weddings, birthdays, celebrations, these are joyous moments. But when you have these moments and you\'ve lost someone, the joy becomes bittersweet."\n\nEarlier this year Claire became a mum. "It was really hard going through the pregnancy without my mum and dad," she said.\n\n"I feel we\'ve been robbed. My parents would have been fantastic grandparents. They were so loving and so generous with their time."\n\nLast year, 1,600 fatalities were reported in road collisions in England, Scotland and Wales. This represented a slight fall of 1% compared with 2023.\n\nSpeed was the most common factor recorded in fatal collisions, according to official statistics published by the Department for Transport.\n\nThe data also indicates that although more casualties occur on roads in urban areas, collisions in rural areas are more likely to result in death.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of road fatalities, 60%, occurred in rural areas - despite those roads taking 45% of traffic. Motorways accounted for just 6% of deaths.\n\nNicholas Lyes, from the road safety charity I AM Roadsmart, described the death of Claire\'s parents as "an example of serious speeding and dangerous driving, probably one of the worst examples that I\'ve seen for quite some time".\n\nHe said investment is needed to make rural roads safer.\n\nOn road safety in general, Mr Lyes said: "I feel that we\'ve had something of a lost decade.  We\'ve seen the number of road traffic collisions and particularly serious [incidents], effectively plateaued. So we\'re not seeing any great improvement on the numbers."\n\nHe argues a "perceived lack of enforcement" could have a part to play on this, but adds "what we really need to see is an updated road safety strategy".\n\nThe government is expected to publish a new road safety strategy by the end of the year.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said it was "committed to reducing deaths and injuries on our roads, and our forthcoming Road Safety Strategy, the first in over a decade, will set out further measures to keep people safe."\n\nClaire\'s anger at the driver who killed her parents is palpable as she speaks to the BBC in her new house in south-west London.\n\n"The fact anyone could be so selfish just shocks me today," she said.\n\nShe would like her story to make people to think carefully about how they drive.\n\n"We need to see a cultural change in how we approach speeding and road safety in general," she said.\n\n"When we talk about speeding we kind of dismiss it, people say \'oh god, a speeding fine\'. They kind of shrug their shoulders and it\'s almost like it\'s socially acceptable. But it shouldn\'t be.\n\n"A few seconds is all it takes. My life is completely changed because of it.\n\n"Speeding, even for a few seconds, it\'s not worth it. Get to your destination five minutes later," she said.\n\n"If you are caught speeding and you go on a speed awareness course, or get your three points on your licence, take it really seriously and learn from that. And if you can\'t learn from it, then you shouldn\'t be driving."\n\nChief Inspector Craig West of Kent Police\'s Roads Policing Unit urged motorists to observe the Highway Code, particularly in poor weather conditions.\n\n"We remind road users that stopping distances double in wet weather and can be up to 10 times greater in snow and ice. Please drive responsibly, especially as the winter weather sets in," he said.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 47, 462558), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 47, 462558)}

That includes funding for cyber security and gas pipe replacement.\n\nThe £10.3bn in electricity funding will go towards projects including replacing ageing infrastructure, investing in new transmission lines and reinforcing the electricity grid so power can be moved around the network.\n\nOfgem said the investment would also reduce inefficiencies in the system such as offshore windfarms being paid billions a year to switch off as the grid cannot take their power.\n\nAt the moment, when it is very windy, the electricity grid cannot cope with the amount of energy generated by the UK\'s offshore windfarms as\n\nSpeaking ahead of Ofgem\'s announcement, Scottish Power chief executive Keith Anderson told the BBC\'s Today programme the removal of constraints in the system was important.\n\n"It will give us a system that is fit for purpose for the country for the 21st Century," he said.\n\nNational Gas owns and operates Britain\'s gas transmission network, and will receive funding through the Ofgem plan.\n\nIts chief executive Jon Butterworth welcomed the investment, saying it confirmed "the critical role that the gas transmission system plays in Britain\'s energy security now and for decades to come".\n\nHe said the company would undertake a detailed review of the decision in the coming weeks to ensure that it also "supports the country\'s clean energy ambitions".\n\nLawrence Slade, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said Ofgem\'s announcement was "a significant point in our plans for delivering an electricity transmission network that will supply the clean, more affordable and secure energy the country needs for future growth".\n\nEnergy UK chief executive Dhara Vyas said the increased investment was critical, but the added cost for businesses and households needed to be considered by the government so that it was funded "in the fairest way possible" and with certainty around future costs.\n\nGreenpeace UK\'s senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, said the energy grid was "no longer fit for purpose" and needed immediate, vital upgrades. But he added there must be "robust safeguards and strong regulation" to protect bill payers and provide value for money.\n\nSimon Francis from campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition echoed the concerns from Greenpeace, saying network and transmission companies should not be handed a blank cheque and should come with "proper scrutiny".\n\nto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC\'s Justin Rowlatt.

They come on the heels of $89 million in\n\nrevealed by CNBC in an August report.\n\nIn total, Willow Wealth investors have lost at least $208 million, according to CNBC reporting.\n\nWillow Wealth also removed a decade of historical performance data from public view in recent weeks. A chart on the company\'s website showing annualized returns of negative 2% for real estate investments from 2015 to 2025 — down from 9.4% gains just two years prior — has been taken down.\n\n"They had to change their name," said\n\n, a professor at Boston University\'s Questrom School of Business. "Their old name had negative value to it, so they\'re trying to do a 2.0 to restart things. They\'re also making it harder to uncover their poor performance by removing the stats, which is alarming."\n\nThe high-stakes rebranding is the latest chapter for a company that sought to empower retail investors, but instead left some of them saddled with deep losses and years of uncertainty.\n\nUnder its former name, Willow Wealth — backed by prominent venture firms and buoyed by aggressive online marketing — had been the best known of a wave of American startups that promised to broaden access to the alternative investments that are the domain of institutions and rich families.\n\nBut the still-unfolding collapse of its real estate funds demonstrates the risks the private markets hold for retail investors. By their very nature, private investments don\'t trade on exchanges and lack standardized disclosures. That leaves investors especially reliant on private fund managers, both for information and to safeguard their interests for years while their money is locked up in deals.\n\nPrivate markets have gained in prominence this year after President\n\nto allow\xa0the investments\xa0in retirement plans.\n\nWhile critics say that opaque, illiquid investments with high management fees aren\'t appropriate for ordinary investors, asset managers including\n\nsee retail as a vast untapped pool of capital. Retirement giant Empower said in May that it would allow private assets into the 401(k) plans of participating employers with help from firms including Apollo and\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Willow Wealth CEO\n\n, a former E-Trade chief who took the helm in May, said the company was heading toward a\n\n. Instead of only offering deals sourced by the startup, it would also sell private market funds from Wall Street giants including Goldman and\n\nThe company no longer provides the historical performance of its offerings because of the pivot to third party-managed funds, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked for anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\n\n"Transparency is paramount to us, and we consistently provide strategy-specific performance information for each manager at the offering level to support informed decision making," said a Willow Wealth spokeswoman.\n\nAs for CNBC\'s reporting on the new real estate defaults and rising tally of losses, the Willow Wealth spokeswoman called it a "rehash" of news on "investments from five years ago."\n\n"The investments in question represent a very small portion of our overall portfolio and do not reflect the current nature of our offerings or business focus," she said.\n\nThe firm declined to say how much it manages in assets.\n\nThe startup — founded in 2015 by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, who remain on Willow Wealth\'s\n\nof directors — told customers that private investments would provide both higher returns and lower volatility than traditional assets.\n\nWillow Wealth\'s pitch hasn\'t changed much, despite the rebrand.\n\nIn a new ad campaign, a character called\n\nsays that he\'s "learned a thing or two about crashes" and therefore uses Willow Wealth to diversify his portfolio with private market assets including real estate.\n\nThe mascot, a play on the Humpty-Dumpty nursery rhyme,\n\nthat "portfolios including private markets have outperformed traditional ones for the past 20 years."\n\nOn its revamped website, the firm has a\n\nshowing a hypothetical portfolio made of private equity, private credit and real estate outperforming traditional stocks and bonds over the decade through 2025.\n\nBut the chart doesn\'t include the impact of fees, which are typically far higher for private investments than for stock ETFs and mutual funds. The company also notes in a disclosure that customers can\'t actually invest in the private market indexes listed.\n\nWhile most stock ETFs carry fees below 0.2%, Willow Wealth typically charges 10 times more than that, or 2% annually on unreturned funds, for its real estate offerings, according to product documents.\n\nWillow Wealth also charged an array of one-time fees associated with the creation of the funds, including for structuring the deal and arranging the loans.\n\nFees for Willow Wealth\'s new products are even higher. The company charges about 1.4% annually for access to portfolios made up of private funds from Goldman Sachs, Carlyle and the\n\nThose firms also charge their own fees, leading to all-in annual costs ranging from about 3.3% to 6.7% per fund, according to the providers\' documents.\n\nThat makes Willow Wealth\'s products among the most expensive in the retail investing universe.\n\nFor customers still coming to terms with their losses and who remain in limbo on funds that the firm says are on "\n\n" for possible default, Yieldstreet\'s transformation into Willow Wealth looks like an effort to evade accountability, the customers told CNBC.\n\nAfter last week\'s disclosures, nine out of the 30 real estate\n\nreviewed by CNBC since August are now in default. That 30% failure rate is high, even by the standards of the private assets world, said Boston University\'s Williams.\n\nThough the realm of private credit is more opaque, making average default rates difficult to pinpoint, some in the industry estimate typical failure rates of between 2% and 8%.\n\nWhether they were apartments in hot downtown areas or established cities, or single-family homes scattered across Southern boomtowns, projects that Willow Wealth put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets and fell behind on loan payments.\n\nWillow Wealth has blamed the failures on the Federal Reserve\'s interest\n\ncycle in 2022, which made repaying floating-rate debt harder.\n\nAmong newly disclosed defaults are a pair of funds tied to a 268-unit luxury apartment building in East Nashville called\n\nInvestors hoping to earn the advertised 16.4% annual return put a combined $18.2 million into the two funds, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. They later added another $2 million in a member loan meant to stabilize the deal.\n\n"Your equity investment is expected to incur a full loss" after selling Stacks on Main on Nov. 25, Willow Wealth told customers in a letter dated that same day. Investors in the member loan will lose up to 60%, the company said.\n\n"We understand this is difficult news to receive," Willow Wealth told customers. "We share in your disappointment."\n\nDocuments for the 2022 transactions listed Nazare Capital, the family office of former WeWork CEO\n\nas the sponsor for the deal. Real estate sponsors typically source, acquire and manage deals on behalf of investors.\n\nIn 2022, after his WeWork tenure ended, Neumann\n\nproperty startup Flow, which took on some of the real estate deals from his family office.\n\nto news outlets over the past year, representatives from Flow have sought to distance the company from the travails of then-Yieldstreet.\n\nBut according to the 2022 investment memo, Nazare purchased Stacks on Main in July 2021 for $79 million and then offloaded a majority stake to Yieldstreet members through a joint venture.\n\nCrucially, the transaction saddled the joint venture with $62.1 million in debt, a burden which would later prove instrumental in the deal\'s failure, CNBC found.\n\n"This building was majority-owned by YieldStreet and the property was never operated either by Flow or anyone associated with Adam," a spokeswoman for Neumann told CNBC. "In any event, the building has been sold and Flow no longer has a minority interest nor any involvement in this property."\n\nNazare was also listed as sponsor for another Nashville project that went sideways for retail investors, an apartment complex at\n\n. That project resulted in $35 million in losses across two funds, wipeouts that were previously\n\nBesides the deals tied to Nazare, there were other defaults.\n\nfund, made up of apartments across suburban Texas, resulted in a loss of all $21 million of customer funds, the startup told investors in a Nov. 25 letter.\n\n"The property was unable to generate sufficient revenue to pay monthly debt service and operating expenses" and went into foreclosure, resulting in a "full loss of the equity," Willow Wealth said.\n\nThe tally of Willow Wealth\'s investor losses is likely to rise further.\n\nFor instance, an $11.6 million loan made by Willow Wealth customers for a Portland, Oregon, multifamily project is "currently in default" after an appraisal found that the borrower owed more than the real estate was worth, the company told investors.\n\nWillow Wealth is trying to restructure the borrower\'s loan to avoid selling the property for a loss, the company said in a letter to investors.\n\nThe company has also warned investors that a Tucson, Arizona, apartment complex and two projects made up of single-family rental homes across Southern states were likely to result in future losses of unspecified amounts, according to separate letters. Investors put more than $63 million combined into those deals.\n\nWilliams, the Boston University professor and a\n\nFederal Reserve bank examiner, said he taught a class this fall on how Willow Wealth and other fintech firms failed to protect their customers.\n\n"They claimed they were going to democratize access to the types of deals only the rich had," Williams said.

But as important as where bitcoin\'s price goes next is a question about the role bitcoin really serves in a portfolio: When will it consistently behave like a store of value?\n\n"It\'s still going to have to prove itself as that digital store value over a longer period of time," Nate Geraci, NovaDius Wealth Management president, said on the\n\nhas been described as "digital gold," a\n\nthat can be powerful and appealing to investors since\n\nduring periods of broader market stress, moving in a manner uncorrelated to stocks and other risk assets. But for bitcoin, the digital gold narrative is undermined whenever it trades like a risk asset during equity selloffs. After two distinct periods of volatility in 2025, bitcoin hasn\'t been able to provide a clear answer to the digital gold question.\n\n"The track record thus far is mixed," Geraci said.\n\nHe pointed to the "tariff tantrum" period of stock selling in April after President Trump announced sweeping global tariffs, a period of market volatility during which bitcoin performed very well. "That caught a lot of investors attention," he said.\n\nBut more recently, as weakness in technology stocks led the market down, most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, also sold off. Bitcoin, in particular, sold off considerably more than the stock market, he noted.\n\n"The jury is still out,\' Geraci said.\n\nGeraci stressed that over the long-term, he does believe bitcoin is "heading down that path of acting much more like the physical metal itself."\n\nBut he added that for now, it is acting more like a volatile "teenager."\n\n"It is only 15 to16 years old, so still has to prove itself as that digital store of value," he said.\n\nGold, on the other hand, has a\n\n"It\'s story is still in its early chapters," Geraci wrote in a follow-up email to CNBC.\n\nGeraci said it is good to have some perspective during any short-term bout of volatility. While bitcoin is down over 25% since its record high price in October (from its record high to its recent low the loss was an even steeper 35%), it has more than doubled in value since January 2024, when there was an influx of spot bitcoin ETFs to the market after SEC approvals.\n\nAdditionally, while spot bitcoin ETFs have seen billions in\n\n, since the beginning of the year, they have attracted roughly $22 billion in inflows.\n\nHe thinks that while the recent bitcoin crash began as a function of the tech stock selling and broader equity market selloff, leverage in the crypto market ultimately played a large role in the prolonged decline. "I just think there was a lot of leverage in the category that needed to be flushed out," he said. "And I think that\'s what we\'re seeing now."\n\nBeyond bitcoin itself, Geraci thinks crypto index ETFs, portfolios that invest in a basket of digital assets rather than tracking the spot market in any single cryptocurrency, may become a way more investors seek diversification in the new asset class.\n\nBut he also thinks bitcoin will be an exception in the crypto market, where he expects many assets will continue to trade more like tech stocks and investors should expect to see them falling right alongside stocks in equity market drawdowns.\n\n"Setting bitcoin aside, I view most other crypto tokens as risk assets – much closer to high-growth technology stocks than stores of value. Their investment case is tied to the future of stablecoins, tokenization, and decentralized finance," Geraci wrote via email.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 56, 609044), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 8, 2, 6, 56, 609044)}
