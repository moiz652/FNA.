No discussion,\'" said Christian Petersen-Clausen, a music agent who has organized more than 70 concerts in China over the last 12 months.\n\n"Everything Japanese is canceled now," he said. He added that he\'d spent six months getting Chinese censors\' approval to allow The Blend to perform in the country.\n\nDDC announced Thursday afternoon that the evening\'s concert was canceled due to force majeure and that ticket holders would be\n\nJapanese singer-songwriter Kokia\'s Wednesday evening concert in Beijing was also canceled,\n\n. Its public announcement, dated Thursday, blamed technical issues.\n\nAgain, there was little advance notice. One social media post from a fan described\n\nthe venue for more than an hour, until well past the time the concert was scheduled to start.\n\nOther concerts by Japanese artists in China have also been\n\nIt appears to be the latest fallout from an\n\nbetween China and Japan over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\'s\n\nindicating Tokyo would support Taiwan if seriously threatened by Beijing\'s military. Beijing claims territorial rights to Taiwan, a democratically self-governed island. Taiwan rejects this claim and says that only its people can decide its future.\n\n"The pace and scale of Beijing\'s reactions ... are quite unprecedented," said George Chen, partner of The Asia Group, a business policy consultancy based in Washington, D.C. He added\xa0that\xa0the biggest risk for Japanese brands in China would be a nationwide boycott, although\xa0so far there are limited signs that Chinese consumers are avoiding the brands at scale.\n\nTwo Chinese ministries late last week started\n\n.

CNBC was unable to reach the culture ministry for comment as it was outside of Beijing business hours.\n\nAnd it\'s not just music that is potentially affected,\n\n— something China\'s commerce ministry declined to confirm or deny. The foreign ministry has only said that, "under current circumstances, there will be\n\neven if they enter China."\n\nThe developments reinforce how top-down policies in China can be abrupt and vague, making it difficult for businesses to plan.\n\n"You don\'t have predictability because nobody announces the policies publicly," music agent Petersen-Clausen said. He said he organized a Japanese concert in Shanghai on Wednesday with no issue, and "nobody has said to us that Saturday[\'s concert] is for sure canceled."\n\nHowever, China\'s rhetoric remains firm, with the foreign ministry on Thursday calling again for Takaichi to\n\nand warning that "if Japan creates trouble on Taiwan, Japan will not get away with it."\n\n"Basically what that means is, I have no hope for Saturday," Petersen-Clausen added.\n\nThe venue had expected around 200 attendees on Thursday alone, he said, adding that around 20 Chinese people would have gotten paid for related work around both shows. Tickets for the jazz performance were listed at the equivalent of between $40 and $70 each.\n\nThe movie industry could also come under pressure. The local release of Japanese animated films featuring Crayon Shinchan and the "Cells at Work" series have been postponed, Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Wednesday.\n\nbased on falling Chinese interest in Japanese films.\n\n"The risk to Beijing is that the perception that it has overreacted reinforces anti-China sentiment in Japan, as it did in South Korea," Teneo analysts said in a report.\n\n"If Beijing chooses to continue ramping up pressure over the incident, additional measures could include new barriers to imports from Japan justified by trade investigations or product safety concerns."\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, international music performances are often the first affected by geopolitical disputes.\n\nFollowing Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, some venues in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nappearances or shows involving artists believed to be supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin. China has also\n\nfor nearly a decade to protest a new missile system, although there are indications these acts could return soon.\n\nFor Petersen-Clausen, the uncertainty around concerts in China is hurting business.\n\n"Foreign musicians have refused bookings from us because they said we don\'t know if it will actually go ahead or be canceled," he said. "This word has gotten around that China is sometimes unstable. That is a problem for us if we want to foster people-to-people exchanges."\n\n"If we don\'t get stability and predictability," he said, ”I\'m going to have to disclose a very significant risk that is an unnecessary risk to potential investors."\n\ndid not include China, although Mariah Carey and the Black Eyed Peas both performed in the mainland this year. Chinese policymakers have sought to encourage some live events as a way to\n\nand the overall economy.\n\nBut national leaders also have other priorities.\n\n"Along with sports, music and arts are the first things governments \'rediscover\' as a means to engage or re-engage," said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n"What happened to diplomacy?" he said.

The token\'s plunge to that price — its lowest since April 11— marks a steepening of bitcoin\'s decline following widespread cascading liquidations of highly leveraged crypto positions in October.\n\n"Price action has been unimpressive across the large tokens, BTC dipping below the year-start price as long-time and larger holders of the token have become more active," Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Friday in a note to clients. "ETF flows, the main driver of BTC prices, are also drying up, adding to the short-term performance worries."\n\nBitcoin has since regained some of its losses to trade down 4% to $82,939.59, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency has fallen 12% since the beginning of the week and roughly 26% over the last month.\n\nThe token\'s slide follows mounting pressure in the U.S. stock market, which has led investors to rotate out of volatile assets like crypto and artificial intelligence stocks into safe-havens such as gold.

Why John Williams' remarks matter so much", 'body': 'Communication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.\n\nMessages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.\n\nfrom the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed\'s leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair\n\nand Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.\n\nSo when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a "further adjustment in the near term" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n"There is some ambiguity in the phrase \'near term\' – but its most obvious reading is at the next meeting," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note.\n\n"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other members of the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell\'s sign-off," he added.\n\nWilliams\' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.\n\nThe policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself\n\nOn one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.\n\nWhile Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.\n\nThat\'s particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and\n\n, with futures turning around after Williams\' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group\'s\n\nWilliams likely saved the market Friday from a potential sell-off that appeared to be taking shape, with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming Friday.

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o', 'title': "Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning", 'body': 'Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan "a stone-cold loser", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.\n\nAll this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.\n\nThis week\'s second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.\n\nThere will again be protests and Lord Mandelson\'s sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.\n\nPlanning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.\n\nAnd for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.\n\nFor those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.\n\nSuch has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor "Trumpton", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children\'s TV show.\n\nFor Palace officials, attention to detail is all.\n\nOne of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.\n\nIt needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps\' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nThere has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George\'s Hall.\n\n"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations," said one royal insider.\n\n"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."\n\nMuch thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve "lots of nods to his Scottish heritage".\n\nKing Charles III\'s seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.\n\nOfficials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.\n\nSo far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.\n\nThe president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.\n\n"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that\'s been the challenge," one courtier told me.\n\nThe scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It\'s a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)\n\nFor the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.\n\nOne Whitehall source said: "The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it\'s all about TV and this is great TV."\n\nAnother said: "It\'s theatre. It\'s all show. It\'s not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."\n\nLord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK\'s strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world "the fullest honour British protocol allows" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.\n\n"This state visit is not just a UK-US event," he said. "It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.\n\n"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK\'s wider international standing."\n\nMany officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.\n\nThey emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.\n\n"Trump can be quite funny in private," said one diplomat. "He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."\n\nFor the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.\n\nBeyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister\'s country residence at Chequers.\n\nMinisters hope to complete a deal to\n\nand aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.\n\nThe centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\n\nThis was Lord Mandelson\'s priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as "my personal pride and joy", that he claimed would "help write the next chapter of the special relationship".\n\nAll these issues will be portrayed as big domestic "wins" to help promote the government\'s growth agenda.\n\nThe visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.\n\nJeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president\'s thinking.\n\n"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better," Hunt said.\n\n"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."\n\nSophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King\'s College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.\n\n"We are moving into a new phase," she said. "This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."\n\nFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.\n\nThe peer\'s dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein\'s conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.\n\nInstead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?\n\nSome diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.\n\nBut perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.\n\nAccording to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.\n\nIt was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week\'s royal and political ceremonial.\n\nDiplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson\'s departure, saying it is the UK\'s business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.\n\nBut there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.\n\nThe Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: "On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China.\n\n"The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."\n\nPerhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East.\n\nNext week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called "two state solution".\n\nBut the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment "to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism".\n\nThere are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships.\n\nYet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him.\n\nThe government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.\n\nAmid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes?\n\n"The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King\'s letter in the Oval Office," said one royal source.\n\n"They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can\'t in Whitehall.\n\n"The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."\n\nOfficial state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week\'s does matter.\n\nBut even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. "This is very early in Trump\'s presidency," one diplomat said.\n\n"Have we played this card too soon?

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9865l8540eo', 'title': "How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump", 'body': 'This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit.\n\nThe candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina\'s entire annual economic output.\n\nRather than \'trimming the fat\', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as "la casta" - the caste.\n\nMilei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a "libertarian superhero" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television.\n\nAccording to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation.\n\nYet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%.\n\nThe UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a "template" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as "my favourite president".\n\nThey will meet in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nForeign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington\'s decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina\'s currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei\'s fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei\'s meeting will hail the deal.\n\nYet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei\'s reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes.\n\n"He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by \'la casta\' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen," says Mercedes D\'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate.\n\nBut, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. "The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste."\n\nMilei\'s critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession.\n\nMilei has created a paradox.\n\nOn paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project.\n\nWith midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains?\n\nAround 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. "We\'re all going backwards economically," he says. "I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees."\n\nFor three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them.\n\nNow, Mr Sobol says he can\'t afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he\'s deciding what his family will have to go without too.\n\nArgentina\'s multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes "daily" closures and job losses.\n\nUnlike Trump\'s approach of raising tariffs to promote "America First", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports.\n\n"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don\'t pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field," Mr Galfione argues.\n\nHe believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. "Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more."\n\nMr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes.\n\nAnd yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines.\n\nIn the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts.\n\nAs well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF.\n\n"The demand for public spending was brutal," argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei.\n\n"Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn\'t recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending."\n\nInflation ate away the peso currency\'s purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight.\n\n"Everything was a huge mess," explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria.\n\n"People felt money slipping like water through their fingers."\n\nFor many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change.\n\nHe went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting \'afuera!\' - \'out!\'\n\nAmong other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices.\n\nHis initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell.\n\nWhen I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher\'s face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was "brilliant."\n\nLast month one British newspaper described Milei\'s own approach as having "echoes of Thatcherism".\n\nMiguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei\'s economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. "When you bear in mind the starting point, that\'s a huge accomplishment," he says.\n\nHe believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less.\n\nBut Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case.\n\nJavier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina\'s Congress.\n\n"Being so detached kind of shields him," Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of "signs of empathy in public life".\n\nOn 7 September Milei\'s party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt.\n\nFinancial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year.\n\nTrump\'s £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D\'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in "people\'s real lives".\n\n"We\'re going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina\'s infrastructure."\n\nSome of Milei\'s supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to "break" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power.\n\n"Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back," says Mr Boggiano. "I think Milei will become a model for other countries."\n\nOthers are unsure. "There is some stability which helps things not to explode," said Mr Cibils. "But I think that stability is also a mirage."\n\nMilei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country\'s reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn\'t crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year.\n\nOne former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei\'s strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can\'t pay its debts.\n\n"If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it\'s a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed," says the economist.\n\nThe left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending.\n\nAs to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for.\n\nMany workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a "normalisation".\n\nBut even as leaders abroad watch Milei\'s experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it.\n\nIf normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the \'macro\' successes.\n\n"He has no political expertise, and I think you need it," Prof Rapetti argues.\n\nStill, he believes it is too early to judge: "We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn\'t finished."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 41, 536398), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 41, 536398)}

I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries," says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. "It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"\n\nThe store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nInstead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street.\n\nMore than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That\'s after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid "challenging trading conditions".\n\nIt does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year.\n\nElsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK\'s biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales.\n\nThese places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops.\n\nSo why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time?\n\nOne thing is clear - we\'re not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed.\n\n"[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops," says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. "[They\'re doing this] by saying, \'These are things I\'m going to buy from you.\'\n\n"They know their prices inside out."\n\nSometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices.\n\nBut that\'s not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition.\n\nAll big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year\'s Budget, but it\'s more difficult when you\'re selling the cheapest products because there\'s less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers.\n\nFor pound shops in particular, it\'s even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn\'t what it used to be.\n\nAfter inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today.\n\nChris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail\'s bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago.\n\nIn 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It\'s now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above.\n\n"We realised the pound game wasn\'t going to work any more," he says. "What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn\'t get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."\n\nBut Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right.\n\nHis Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries.\n\n"We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they\'re going to buy it," he declares.\n\nAs for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can\'t he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers.\n\n"We\'ve got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices," he says.\n\nSo, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of "extra margin".\n\nIf you don\'t get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel.\n\nThe father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later.\n\n"They just didn\'t understand the discount business," he argues. "They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."\n\nWilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nPoundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making.\n\nThe business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices.\n\nIts owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn\'t popular with shoppers.\n\n"Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple," says Catherine Shuttleworth.\n\nBut she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan.\n\nThis has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead.\n\nThe main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then.\n\nBack in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents.\n\nAnd shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains.\n\nDiscount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes.\n\nBy 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car.\n\nBut budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis.\n\nNot only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of "extreme discounting" online to contend with.\n\nToday, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops\' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There\'s also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers.\n\n"AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it\'s growing," says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel.\n\nSales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period.\n\nAmazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul.\n\n"If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you\'d find on Temu etc, so if Amazon\'s doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it\'s notable," says Mr Carroll.\n\n"There\'s a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn\'t slowing down, and I think there\'s much more to come."\n\nThere are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock.\n\n"As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that," she says.\n\n"It\'s not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."\n\nThe danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market.\n\nAll this coupled with a "cost-of-business crisis" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers\' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth.\n\n"You\'ve got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you\'re at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it\'s super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there\'s so many people in that market.\n\n"But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."\n\nIt\'s not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently.\n\nThe Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too.\n\nSavers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland\'s Peckham store space.\n\nOneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs.\n\n"Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."\n\nAs for current trading, he says, he is getting by. "We\'re not saying we\'re earning fortunes of money. We\'re not - but we\'re paying our way, and we\'re just waiting for better times."\n\nHis focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading.\n\n"It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas," he says.\n\nCatherine Shuttleworth reckons that\'s where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. "They\'re a great place to go and deck your house out."\n\nBut also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park.\n\n"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby," she adds, "but for others it\'s an absolute necessity."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 43, 28086), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 43, 28086)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397n3jl3z8o', 'title': 'The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high', 'body': 'That\'s a rise of 134% since 2020, and it\'s up 29% just in the past year.\n\nIn cafes and restaurants it\'s a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ.\n\nOne colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price.\n\nYet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs.\n\nThe public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit.\n\nAll of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again.\n\nPlus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\nIt is a perfect storm.\n\nYet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you\'ll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive.\n\nIt all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?\n\nWhere else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two.\n\nThe US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn\'t taste like turpentine.\n\nOrange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added.\n\nWW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid.\n\nIt was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being "better for your health".\n\nWestern consumption of orange juice surged.\n\nFlash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.\n\nAt an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald.\n\nHis firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine.\n\nToday it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers.\n\nBut prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year.\n\nThis followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.\n\n"Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels," Maxim tells me. "At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo.\n\n"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers."\n\nUntil 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n\nProducers have tried to look beyond South America but it\'s not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil.\n\nMorocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)\n\nEven within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates.\n\nIn a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn\'t, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.\n\nFlorida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening.\n\nOne problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet.\n\n"Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice \'Florida Orange\'," says Maxim McDonald.\n\n"It\'s very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it\'s too expensive."\n\nOne of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes.\n\nTropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it.\n\nOne of Tropicana\'s recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an "essentials" brand of orange juice "blends" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it.\n\nThese developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.\n\nThen there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs.\n\nOranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it.\n\nUS exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to "forgo Florida orange juice".\n\nThe Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices.\n\nIn 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this.\n\nAnd while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.\n\nThen there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures.\n\nThe rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles.\n\nIn August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago.\n\nThough this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice.\n\n"When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years," suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData.\n\nDemand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.\n\nUltimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse.\n\n"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced," says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, "Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers."\n\nOthers in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year\'s high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains.\n\nAs for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it.\n\nIt\'s a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills.\n\nBut the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.\n\nOranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time.\n\n"It might be the retailers didn\'t full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it\'s a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got," says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.\n\nUltimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected.\n\n"What we don\'t know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It\'s difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts."\n\nThere is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?\n\nA 2024 government report on food security noted: "The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood...\n\n"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks."\n\nAnd so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 43, 684884), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 43, 684884)}

This caught the imagination of people around the world, and sales rose sharply.\n\nAnnual exports from South Korea increased from $650m in 2011 to $4bn in 2017, according to official figures, a sixfold rise in just six years.\n\nRecognising this huge jump in demand, cosmetics brand Seoul Ceuticals was launched in 2017, named after the South Korean capital.\n\n"We started to see this increase in growth in interest in K-beauty, and began developing a skincare brand to meet that demand… when we really saw it emerging in the US," says Seoul Ceuticals\' director of retail relationship Ann Majeski.\n\n"It has been extremely successful. We expect to do over $14m in sales in 2025. We\'ve seen a global acceptance and demand for the K-beauty products. We\'ve started selling in India, Latin America, Europe and Australia."\n\nBut Seoul Ceuticals is not a Korean company. It is based in the US, where it also manufacturers all its products.\n\nThe business doesn\'t claim to be Korean, but it does say that it makes\n\nThat may sound like a contradiction, but the company says it isn\'t because its ingredients are sourced from South Korea.\n\n"I think we were a little more sensitive about it when we were first starting, because we wanted to be very transparent that the products are made in the US," says Ms Majeski.\n\n"[But] we source our ingredients in Korea… we wanted to be able to legitimately say we are a K-beauty brand."\n\nBut not everyone would agree with this.\n\n"The products should be manufactured by a Korean manufacturer," says Seung Gu Kim, co-founder of K-beauty cosmetics firm Hwarangpoom.\n\nHe runs the business with his wife Elisa Ahonpää-Kim. While they are based in Finland, all of their team except Elisa are Korean, and all their products are made in South Korea.\n\n"The most important thing that we both absolutely agree is that the brand should develop its concept, and ideas, and products with a Korean perspective," says Mr Kim.\n\n"That can come through in the ingredients, the design. Or cultural elements, basically anything that clearly connects to the brands to Korea, or at least reflects a Korean influence."\n\nHowever, the couple do admit that the definition of K-beauty remains complex.\n\n"I guess it\'s a very vague concept, because on the market you will find a lot of brands that are made by Koreans who live abroad," says Ms Ahonpää-Kim.\n\n"And then brands like Lancôme and Clinique manufacture their products in Korea and Japan, but then it doesn\'t make those brands Japanese and Korean."\n\nThere is currently no official definition of K-beauty. And there is no protected designation of origin to defend it, like in the case of Champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.\n\nAnd there is no plan to set one up, according to the K-beauty Industry Association, the only K-beauty trade body officially approved by the South Korean government.\n\n"We are currently more focused in promoting and expanding K-beauty," says the organisation\'s chairman Chang Nam Jang.\n\n"While the trend is quite established in Asia, it is only just starting in Europe and the US, and we don\'t want to throttle the growth by imposing any sanctions on them."\n\nHowever, the association does have rules for its members – they must be companies that are registered in South Korea, and their products must be officially tested and approved by Korea Food & Drug Administration. That approval is required in order to sell inside South Korea.\n\n"If a product is developed in a way that suits the climate and environment of Korea, and is recognized as a viable product in the Korean market, then we would acknowledge it as K-beauty," says Mr Jang.\n\nHwarangpoom agrees with this definition, and has received approval from KFDA.  And Seoul Ceuticals has also started the process to attain KFDA approval, to bring their products to Korean consumers.\n\nWith K-beauty exports from South Korea in 2024\n\nthere is a lot of money to be made in the sector whether the firms are homegrown or not.\n\nIn fact, South Korea is now the largest exporter of cosmetic products after France and the US.\n\nHowever, this success has spawned counterfeiters.\n\nMark Lee is the CEO of MarqVision, a US-based business helps firms spot fakes and get them removed from sale.\n\n"For a major Korean beauty brand, which I cannot disclose, we recently conducted 29 test purchases across major US marketplaces," he says. "Twenty six of them were fake. So that\'s a 90% counterfeit rate."\n\nAnd in 2024 as a whole, Marqvision identified $280m worth of fake K-beauty products in the US market alone.\n\nThe high number of counterfeits greatly frustrated K-beauty fan Gracie Tullio. "Shopping online for K-beauty was a really scary experience," she says.\n\nThis led to London-based Ms Tullio launching PureSeoul in 2019, a K-beauty retail business that sells authentic products sourced directly from Korean manufacturers.\n\nShe says she gets customers who visit the shop with suspected fake products to check if they are real.\n\n"Even our customers can be sometimes tempted by the lower price [of online fakes]. It\'s so tempting for them just to give it a go and see, and nine times out of 10, it\'s not real," she says.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 44, 877485), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 44, 877485)}

The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.\n\nIt\'s an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.\n\nThe intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its "America First" approach.\n\nMilei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his "favourite president".\n\nBut the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdding to the risk is Argentina\'s long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.\n\nFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.\n\nBessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.\n\nThis time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\n\n"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working," Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: "the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people".\n\nThe US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.\n\nBut it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent\'s claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.\n\nBut Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance "buddies" with investments in the country.\n\nEven some members of Trump\'s own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president\'s "America First" goals.\n\nBessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a "bailout", promising there will be "no taxpayer losses" and even declaring the peso "undervalued".\n\nBut while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.\n\nTo the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.\n\nEconomists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.\n\nThe Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei\'s efforts to control inflation.\n\nBut it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.\n\nEconomists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\n\nThat choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\n\n"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?" Mr Setser asks. "Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election."\n\nThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\n\nPeople wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019\n\nafter the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform,\n\nsays Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.\n\n"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that," he said, describing the run as a "confidence crisis."\n\nMr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.\n\nBut the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.\n\nWhile Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.\n\nAnd Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.\n\nKathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise "over the medium term" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.\n\nBut, she adds, "there\'s a lot that needs to be done between now and then".\n\nFor now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\n\n"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management," he says.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 46, 241830), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 46, 241830)}

Many stores are now rounding their cash sales down to the nearest five cents, saying there are no federal guidelines on how to proceed.\n\n"That adds up really quickly," said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump said producing the coin was wasteful and too expensive and on social media called to "rip the waste out of our great nation\'s budget, even if it\'s a penny at a time".\n\nThe US Mint officially stopped making pennies in May. The Treasury Department estimated shortages would start in early 2026, but they actually came much sooner. Banks can\'t get pennies from the federal government, so businesses can\'t get them from the banks.\n\n"We first heard about the issue in late August, early September," Mr Jeon said. "It\'s really impacting any business that deals with cash payments."\n\nNow store clerks don\'t know what to do when their tills are bare and someone needs change in pennies from a cash purchase.\n\nThe temporary solution for many, Mr Jeon said, is rounding the price of the sale up or down to the nearest five cents so the customer can use a nickel, the next lowest tender in the US.\n\nBut some cities, including New York, require retailers to give exact change and others don\'t allow cash payments to differ from card payments for the same item, Mr Jeon said.\n\nTo avoid lawsuits and customer complaints, many retailers have chosen to just round down.\n\n"You\'re talking about losing up to four cents for every cash transaction across multiple stores across the country," he said. "It\'s unsustainable."\n\nMany stores are now urging customers to pay in exact change. Others are hosting promotions for customers to bring in extra pennies they have at home.\n\nConvenience stores are some of the hardest hit by the shortage, said Jeff Lenard, a spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n\nConvenience giant Kwik Trip has announced it is rounding down to the nickel, which it says will cost it up to $3m (£2.3m) this year.\n\nAmerican coins have been discontinued before, including the half-cent, three-cent and 20-cent pieces that were retired in the 1800s, Mr Lenard said. It\'s been many years, though, since a staple like the penny - which entered ciruclation in 1793 - has ceased production.\n\n"People don\'t want the penny until they can\'t get it back in change," he said.\n\nIt costs nearly four cents to make a penny.\n\nBut keeping the zinc and copper coins in circulation will help lower-income Americans who primarily pay in cash, said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents.\n\n"These are people that don\'t have the access to checking accounts and charge cards and banking services," he said. "You hurting lower-income groups when you start rounding transactions."\n\nHe also thinks the government savings from not producing pennies will be offset by the need for more nickels, which are worth five cents but cost nearly 14 cents to make.\n\nPeople watching the penny world believe there needs to be federal guidance for both businesses and shoppers on rounding, how to carry out transactions during the shortage, and generally what to do with the coins.\n\n"There will always be pennies out there, it\'s just such a low-utilisation coin," said Mr Jeon.

Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it.\n\n"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels," says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects.\n\n. It\'s small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways.\n\nNot only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. "If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy," he adds.\n\nAround the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with\n\non their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging.\n\nBut engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects.\n\nA key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid –\n\nto a big connection for powering your trains. "That problem has only become much, much worse," says Mr Murray.\n\nThis is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects.\n\nMr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way.\n\nNow, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain,\n\nfor rail-side renewables projects.\n\n"This is the big one," says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.\n\nNew projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system.\n\nBut for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC).\n\nEfforts are underway in England to develop\n\nthat could solve this problem, though.\n\nSeparately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield.\n\nThe software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation.\n\n"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements," says João Pombo, associate director of the university\'s Institute of Railway Research. "All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August."\n\nBut there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system.\n\nonto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets.\n\n"We eliminate locomotives completely," says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. "Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups."\n\nA key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area.\n\nNevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year.\n\nThese will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. "In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first."\n\nIt would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.\n\nIn the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm\'s wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule.\n\nHe describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – "atomised freight", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be\n\n. "We\'re focused on doing the shorter stuff that they\'re not doing," says Mr Soule.\n\nHe adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. "If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we\'ve doubled the rail industry," he says.\n\nStuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be "quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways".\n\nBut he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the "go-to" option for new railways.\n\n"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case," he says.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 48, 319748), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 48, 319748)}

But he remains actively investing, and he\n\nwhat he sees as the next major mispricing in markets.\n\nCentral to that view is Phil Clifton, Scion\'s former associate portfolio manager, whose research underpins the skepticism. Clifton argues that while generative AI adoption is accelerating, the economics behind the industry\'s massive infrastructure buildout have yet to justify the cost.\n\nIn his farewell letter to Scion investors in late October, Burry called Clifton "the most prodigious thinker" he\'s ever encountered. CNBC obtained several of Clifton\'s research notes from earlier this year, written before he launched his own firm, Pomerium Capital, that help outline Scion\'s bearish thesis on AI.\n\nThe investment world is "expecting far more economic importance out of this technology than is likely to be provided," Clifton wrote. "Just because a technology is good for society or revolutionizes the world doesn\'t mean that it\'s a good business proposition."\n\nOn the surface, AI usage appears ubiquitous. More than 60% of U.S. adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, according to Pew Research Center. Yet Clifton said the economics on the demand side are "surprisingly small."\n\nOpenAI — market leader and cultural phenomenon —\n\nin annualized revenue this year, but that figure is tiny compared with the size of the AI build-out. Hyperscalers have quadrupled their capex spend in recent years to almost $400 billion annually, with expectations of $3 trillion over the next five years, according to Man Group.\n\n"We assume other generative AI services in aggregate are insufficient to justify the sums being spent on infrastructure," Clifton wrote.\n\nScion sees a clear historical parallel with the early-2000s telecom boom, when heavy investment in fiber-optic networks far outpaced actual usage. U.S. capacity utilization fell to about 5%, and wholesale telecom pricing collapsed roughly 70% in a single year, Scion noted.\n\nClifton argues the cloud giants are now in a comparable race, expanding AI infrastructure on the assumption that future demand will catch up eventually. But if mass AI adoption takes longer than expected, the economics on these massive data center deals could become untenable.\n\nSome Big Tech companies are starting to wobble on commitments already, he noted. Microsoft\xa0has canceled data center projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe,\n\n. Alibaba\'s chairman has warned a\n\nNo company has benefited more from AI spending than\n\n. The stock has surged alongside unprecedented GPU orders from cloud providers. But Scion questions whether those customers will ever generate economic returns on that investment.\n\nA key element here is depreciation policy. Tech giants have lengthened server lifespans on the books to six years. Yet Nvidia\'s product cycles run every year now, making older chips functionally obsolete and less energy-efficient, long before they\'ve been written down, Scion claims.\n\nsaying its hardware remains productive far longer than critics say, thanks to efficiencies driven by the company\'s CUDA software system.\n\nStill, Burry and other critics are seizing on a contradiction. Nvidia says the newest chips are superior in performance, efficiency and capability, at the same time as it promises that older chips remain economically viable. One of those defenses, they say, has to give.\n\nto lay out his bearish thesis on AI. Whether generative AI ultimately proves to be a bubble remains to be seen, but for now, Burry is again positioning himself on the cautious side of a fast-moving story.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 49, 285172), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 49, 285172)}

And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power.\n\nIts mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech\'s current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum\n\nfrom tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.\n\nBroadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate.\n\nPut them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that\'s more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word "might" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters.\n\n"The potential is there, but the jury is still out," he says.\n\n"Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI."\n\nIn terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035,\n\nMeanwhile, AI\'s value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles.\n\n"I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged," jokes Mr Hopkins.\n\nIn mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could\n\nwhile mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.\n\nQuantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the "hallucinations" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error.\n\nThese are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them.\n\nIt\'s tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the\n\nQuantum computers don\'t look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big.\n\nThey exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape.\n\nThey require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It\'s not the sort of thing you\'re likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket.\n\nThey\'re also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature.\n\nThe luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world\'s first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020.  And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.\n\nThese machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn\'t stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential.\n\n"We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives," said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC\'s Tech Life podcast.\n\n"The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI."\n\nProf Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK\'s top quantum experts. "Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds," he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4\'s The Life Scientific.\n\nSo what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they\'re ready?\n\nAs with AI, there\'s a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare.\n\nQuantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers.\n\nTo give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world\'s fastest super computers\n\n- or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete.\n\nHazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that\'s most likely to work for you.\n\nAnd that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers.\n\nQuantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks.\n\nIn 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy.\n\n"The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology," said researcher Ryan Hill at the time.\n\n"A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still.\n\n"Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge."\n\nLast year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a "quantum compass", on the city\'s underground Tube network.\n\nGPS doesn\'t work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather.\n\n"The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication," says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK\'s National Quantum Computing Centre.\n\n"Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems."\n\nThe National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what\'s known as "load shedding" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts.\n\nAnd Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.\n\nSo far, so good – but we also need to talk about secrets.\n\nIt is widely accepted that current forms of encryption – the way in which we store both personal data and official secrets – will one day be busted by quantum technology being able to churn through every single possible combination in record time, until the data becomes unscrambled.\n\nNations are known to be already stealing encrypted data from each other with a view to being able to decode it one day.\n\n"It\'s called harvest now, decrypt later," says Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\n"The theory of how to break current forms of public key encryption await a truly operational quantum computer," he adds.\n\n"The threat is so high that it\'s assumed everyone needs to introduce quantum-resistant encryption now."\n\nThe moment a such a computer exists is sometimes referred to as Q-day. Estimates of when it might arrive vary, but Brian Hopkins at Forrester says it could be soon - around the year 2030.\n\nCompanies like Apple and the secure messaging platform Signal have already rolled out what they believe to be post-quantum encryption keys, but they cannot be applied retrospectively to current data encrypted in the traditional way.\n\nAnd that\'s already a problem. In October, Daniel Shiu, the former head of cryptographic design at GCHQ, the UK\'s intelligence, security and cyber agency, told the Sunday Times it was "credible that almost all UK citizens will have had data compromised" in state-sponsored cyber attacks carried out by China – with that data stockpiled for a time when it can be decrypted and studied.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 50, 484355), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 50, 484355)}

I have," says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. "I wouldn\'t recommend it," he adds, however. It\'s very salty, apparently.\n\nBut this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests.\n\n, two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed.\n\nWhat is Burnblock exactly? No-one will say. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock\'s website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is "a natural component in the body" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and "a natural component in some berries".\n\nFlame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries.\n\nBut many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century\n\n. "There hasn\'t been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them," says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US.\n\nWhen you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. "It also releases some water," he adds. "That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire\'s spread." And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. You can add Burnblock to other building materials, he says, including dried seagrass.\n\nHalt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels.\n\n"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire]," says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – "No" is the answer.\n\nIn one of Halt\'s buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. The top one is a tank containing the treatment fluid that I saw earlier. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood\'s pores, says Mr McCann.\n\nThen, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid.\n\n"What that pressure is doing is, it\'s forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber," says Mr McCann.\n\nAfter this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It\'s carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood.\n\n"Timber is an amazing material," says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. He refers to wood\'s ability to take up treatment fluids within its pores. "You can ultimately change the chemistry of its burning behaviour," he says.\n\nHull is often sceptical of new flame retardants, however. He points out that some ideas have come and gone. "There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s," he says. "Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out."\n\nWhile timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains.\n\nDr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, "solid gasoline" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly.\n\nIn Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm\'s solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry.\n\nFirst Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood.\n\nCould graphene affect people\'s health following a fire? A spokeswoman says, "There\'s no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects."\n\nIn the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards.\n\nExperiments suggest that the graphene does reduce the plastic\'s ability to burn. "It hits the highest ratings in those tests," says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer.\n\nBuildings aren\'t just at risk from fires that start inside them, though. "\n\n," says Dr Morgan. That\'s why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage.\n\nProf Appel hopes to test the substance on mini structures, or mock-built homes, soon.\n\nLab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire.\n\n"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, \'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this\'," recalls Prof Appel.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 51, 773993), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 51, 773993)}

They\'re decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nTraditionally advertisers on social media could target people by the demographic segment they were deemed to fit into - for example, if you\'re a student in Edinburgh or a 35-year-old woman who likes yoga. Ads would "follow" you around the internet based on what you\'d been searching.\n\nBut using the ability of AI to draw on vast quantities of data, companies like Cheil UK can create thousands of different ads that are tailored to different personalities and personal situations. The aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them, down to the tone, phrasing, music and colours used.\n\nTo do that Cheil UK has been working with start-up Spotlight on an AI platform. To get extra layers of information they ask large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, lots of questions about a particular brand to find out what people are saying about it on the internet.\n\nFrom those answers they might, for example, be able to create an ad that not only suits a 35-year old woman who likes yoga, but also one that has just been on holiday or was about to get married.\n\n"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level," says Mr Camacho.\n\n"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that\'s when you start to build a picture to understand that individual."\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn\'t mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it\'s still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile," explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University\'s Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done]," he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising \'wastage\' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they\'ve already forgotten it," says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop."\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n"There\'s also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with," says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn\'t whether brands can personalise everything - it\'s whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do."\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n"There\'s going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there\'s going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths," he says.\n\n"And that\'s the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n"We don\'t have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We\'re trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We\'re trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that\'s all we\'ve ever tried to do."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 54, 621934), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 54, 621934)}

It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine.\n\nBefore Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements.\n\nNow, she makes drones for use against the Russians.\n\n"It was just an obvious decision for me," she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. "I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."\n\nMs Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed.\n\n"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones," she recalled. "So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."\n\nThese days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon.\n\nCombat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact.\n\nBefore 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones.\n\n"This has been the first full-blown drone war," says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare.\n\n"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They\'ve become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."\n\nAnd not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power." Ms Pettyjohn says.\n\nThe world\'s biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has\n\nsince Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Europe, Portugal\'s Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany\'s Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due\n\nin Swindon in southwest England at the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be\n\non new military drones.\n\n"The sector is growing really quickly," said Mike Armstrong, Stark\'s managing director for the UK. "I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we\'ve seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."\n\nThe growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down.\n\nAnti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport.\n\nOleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company.\n\n"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones," he says.\n\nSince 2022, DroneShield\'s share price has\n\n"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us," Mr Vornik adds.\n\nAs well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China\'s use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs.\n\nMunin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army.\n\n"We\'re building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones," he says. "It\'s a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it\'s coming in."\n\nExperts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger.\n\nBut Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. "That is going to be the next real shift.\n\n"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."\n\nIn the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line.\n\n"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course," she says. "A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers.\n\n"But this is a question of existence.

But it\'s also the toughest crop a farmer can cultivate," says Stanley Pothan, who has been farming cardamom in the southern Indian state of Kerala for decades.\n\nPrized for centuries for its complex, aromatic flavour, cardamom is fiendishly difficult to grow.\n\n"Cardamom is a very delicate plant - prone to diseases and pest attacks. You have to be constantly in the field, watching every leaf, every flower. It demands attention every single day," says Mr Pothan.\n\nIt\'s also extremely sensitive to weather conditions.\n\n"Last year\'s summer was brutal - we lost a significant portion of our crop to the heat. Guatemala, the world\'s largest cardamom producer, lost almost 60% of its crop that season, and we too suffered badly here in Kerala," he adds.\n\nThat poor harvest contributed to a 70% jump in cardamom prices last year to 1,178 rupees (£10; $13) per kilo, up 70% compared to the previous year, according to figures from India\'s Spice Board.\n\nCardamom has always been expensive, usually the third costliest spice by weight, after saffron and vanilla.\n\nFarmers would be keen to raise their output, but it\'s not easy.\n\n"One bad summer or unexpected rain can wipe away the entire effort. That\'s the harsh reality of cardamom farming," says Mr Pothan.\n\nThe government-funded Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI) is trying to ease the burden of tending to cardamom\'s needs.\n\n"Our focus is on crop improvement, pest and disease surveillance, soil management, capacity building, and technology transfer related to cardamom," says Dr A B Reema, Director of the ICRI, which is part of the government\'s Spices Board of India.\n\nOne of its tools is an app that farmers can use to monitor the health of their soil and gives them tailored recommendations on how to best manage it.\n\n"Technology is no longer separate from farming. It is now a daily tool for cardamom growers, from checking soil health on an app, to monitoring rainfall and disease alerts on their phones," says Dr Reema.\n\n"Even small farmers today are using digital tools. They don\'t have to depend only on local advice, they can check the soil quality, moisture, and even disease symptoms right from their field."\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are looking for hardier cardamom varieties.\n\n"We are mainly focusing on developing cardamom varieties that are tolerant to major diseases and pests, while also being high yielding and climate resilient," says Preity Chetty, assistant professor at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Kerala Agricultural University.\n\nThey have made one breakthrough, by finding a cardamom variety that can grow with limited water.\n\nThe researchers are also delving into the genetic make-up for cardamom to find genetic markers for desirable traits. That knowledge should speed up the breeding of more productive plants.\n\n"Unlike other spices, studies on cardamom are limited, especially at the molecular level. There\'s a lack of molecular markers for reproductive or yield traits, which we are now trying to address," says Dr Chetty.\n\nOne key process in cardamom farming is drying the pods once they have been harvested.\n\nTraditionally only the larger farms could afford to set up their own dryers, often fueled by wood.\n\n"Smaller farmers had to depend on middlemen or neighbours for drying, which often affected the quality," says Annu Sunny, who founded the social enterprise, Graamya, in 2016 to help farmers in Kerala.\n\n"As cardamom is the queen of spices and a cash crop lot of people have started get in to cultivation," she says.\n\n"It\'s a very tricky crop. It takes 10 to 12 years to really understand cardamom, how it behaves, what it needs, when to act and when to wait. Every season is like a new experiment," she adds.\n\nTo help farmers with the drying process, Graayma has introduced heat-pump dryers.\n\nGraayma charges 10 rupees per kilo, which is significantly cheaper than wood drying which cost around 14 rupees per kilo.\n\n"The finish of the product is much better, there\'s no smoke, no uneven heating, and the pods retain their natural green colour. That\'s very important because colour decides the price."\n\nGrowing cardamom with the help of fertilisers and pesticides is hard enough, but some farmers are going a step further, by taking an organic approach to cultivation.\n\n"When I first started, I had no idea what I was getting into," says Mathews Geroge, formerly a banker who turned to farming in Kerala in 2020.\n\n"When I first spoke to scientists at the Cardamom Research Institute, they discouraged me. They said cardamom is too sensitive and difficult to grow organically."\n\nInitially they appeared to be right - around 90% of his first crop was destroyed by pests and local traders rejected his cardamom because, to them, it looked in poor condition.\n\nAfter two years of experimentation he turned to the ancient Indian cultivation methods of Vrikshayurveda, which he says has bought more success. But it\'s still not easy.\n\n"Even today, I wouldn\'t say I\'ve mastered cardamom farming. It\'s still a challenge. Some seasons are good, some aren\'t. But now I understand the rhythm of the crop - when to act, when to wait, when to let nature do its job."\n\nUltimately, Mr Geroge thinks organic farming will be able to compete with traditional methods.\n\n"Sustainable farming begins with reducing input costs. Many farmers think organic means expensive, but if you make your own inputs and understand your soil, you can actually earn better with less dependence on chemicals."\n\nOne aspect of cardamom farming that is unlikely to change soon is the need for skilled workers.\n\nMr Pothan estimates that labour accounts for 75% of his costs and most of that is spent at harvest time.\n\n"Harvesting is a skilled job - mostly done by women. They know exactly which capsule is ready and which isn\'t. They may pluck one or two from a bunch and return to the same plant after 45 days for the next round. That\'s why it\'s so labour-intensive," Mr Pothan says.\n\nMs Sunny says those jobs are likely to be secure.\n\n"Mechanisation in cardamom is limited. You can mechanise spraying or de-weeding, but not pruning or harvesting. Every innovator who visits our farm looks at cardamom and says \'we\'ll solve this\'. But nothing concrete has come out yet."\n\nMr Pothan agrees and adds that cardamom demands more than just good process.\n\n"In cardamom, there\'s no shortcut. You can\'t automate everything.

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.\n\nCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.\n\nIt is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.\n\nHe admits that in the past few months "there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here".\n\nThis conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.\n\nTo get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.\n\nBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.\n\nThis resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.\n\nA number of local people, who didn\'t want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.\n\nAlthough Consettur\'s licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.\n\nIt\'s a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\n\n"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here," he says. "This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."\n\nThese partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.\n\nMeanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.\n\nAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.\n\nSpeaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: "We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."\n\nHer friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site "was a nightmare for us". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren\'t doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.\n\nThe mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\n\n"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."\n\nHe wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.\n\nOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that "more needs to be done for the local communities".\n\nShe adds: "We don\'t have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."\n\nCarlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\n\n"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country," he says. "If we don\'t have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can\'t be competitive in the long term."\n\nHe also wants to change tourists\' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\n\n"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area," says Mr Gonzalez. "And let\'s not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."\n\nBut he says that Peru\'s unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\n\n"I\'ve been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."\n\nBack in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he\'d be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\n\n"If they are given the final approval we don\'t have a problem with working with them. We won\'t stop them."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 58, 931114), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 58, 931114)}

A spokesperson said Nandy would "review any new buyer acquiring the Telegraph in line with the public interest and foreign state influence media mergers regimes".\n\nThe Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph\'s previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers.\n\nDame Caroline Dineage, chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committe, said she was "keen to see a resolution to the uncertainty that\'s hampered the Telegraph for years", while "not understating the need for media plurality".\n\n"This situation has been unsustainable for the business and unsettling for staff so I hope the government set out its position early next week," she added.\n\n"The Committee have largely stayed out of the discussion to date, because takeovers are quasi judicial in terms of the Government\'s role."\n\nDMGT and RedBird IMI have said they expect the deal to be finalised quickly.\n\nDMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said he had "long admired the Daily Telegraph" and the deal would give "much-needed certainty and confidence" to its employees.\n\nHe said: "The Daily Telegraph is Britain\'s largest and best quality broadsheet newspaper and I have grown up respecting it. It has a remarkable history and has played a vital role in shaping Britain\'s national debate over many decades."\n\nHe added: "Chris Evans is an excellent editor and we intend to give him the resources to invest in the newsroom.\n\nUnder our ownership, the Daily Telegraph will become a global brand, just as the Daily Mail has."\n\nThe purchase would see the Telegraph become part of DMGT\'s portfolio of media organisations, which includes the i Paper, Metro and New Scientist, along with the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers.\n\nThe group said the Telegraph would remain editorially independent from DMGT\'s other titles.\n\nIt said its case for having the deal approved was "compelling" and would comply with UK regulations, as there would be no foreign state investment or capital in the funding structure.\n\nA spokesman for RedBird IMI said: "DMGT and RedBird IMI have worked swiftly to reach the agreement announced today, which will shortly be submitted to the secretary of state."\n\nElsewhere, Chris Fox, Liberal Democrat Lords\' spokesperson for business, said: "A move towards a potential deal to end the uncertainty that has plagued the Telegraph\'s future should certainly be considered.\n\n"But, of course as Liberals, we are sceptical about concentrating so much agenda-setting power in the hands of so few."\n\nHe urged the competitions\' regulator to "rigorously examine" the terms of the agreement to "ensure we don\'t get an even more unbalanced media market for consumers and competitors".\n\nRedBird Capital pulled out of a deal to buy the Telegraph last week.\n\nIt had a previous attempt to buy the group rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi\'s IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family.\n\nA law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals.\n\nIts more recent bid complied with that rule, but it was understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review.\n\nSources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest.\n\nRedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph\'s reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market.\n\nAmong other investments, RedBird owns the Italian football team AC Milan.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 59, 19868), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 13, 59, 19868)}

The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.\n\nHowever, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers.\n\nThere will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars.\n\nIt is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday\'s Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.\n\nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.\n\n"This is an investment in the country\'s future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that," she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.\n\n"So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that\'s what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision."\n\nAll new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.\n\nThe Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.\n\nNew AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK\'s transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent\n\nthat the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.\n\nEVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.\n\n"It isn\'t yet clear that it\'s prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn\'t have gone ahead and bought anyway," David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.\n\nThe Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.\n\nshows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.\n\n"The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking," the government said.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was "expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge".\n\nHowever, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay.\n\nThe shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.\n\nThe transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers\' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a "fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists".\n\n"EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance."\n\n"We\'ve got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies," Alexander said.\n\n"We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we\'re not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles," she said.\n\nReeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.\n\nRichard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that "handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry" was "madness".\n\n"Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government\'s priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars," the Conservative MP said.\n\nReeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 2, 182720), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 2, 182720)}

which would have been a clear breach of Labour\'s election promise not to raise "the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax".\n\nGovernments sometimes choose to leak aspects of their Budget plans to the media, either to test public reaction or prepare the ground for measures so they do not come as a shock to financial markets or voters.\n\nHaldane branded the months of speculation about potential Budget measures a "fiscal fandango".\n\n"That\'s been costly for the economy," he told the programme.\n\n"It\'s caused paralysis among businesses and consumers."\n\nHe said the Budget process was "too lengthy, too leaky, with real costs".\n\nHaldane acknowledged this "pantomime" had also happened under previous governments, adding that the "budgetary process has been degraded over many years".\n\nChallenged over whether the leaks had damaged the economy, Alexander told the programme: "People always speculate in advance of a Budget and we have always said \'wait until the Budget\'."\n\nDefending the government\'s approach, she said the Budget process had taken place "on shifting sands", with\n\nand "a very challenging global economic environment".\n\nThe Conservatives have called for an investigation into pre-Budget leaks, saying they have "real world consequences including for financial markets".\n\n, shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: "Either ministers have approved the widespread briefing of confidential information surrounding the Budget, or serious unauthorised leaks have occurred within your department."\n\nThe chancellor is expected to set out a range of smaller tax rises in her Budget, after backing away from increasing income tax rates.\n\nHowever, the government has not ruled out\n\n- the level people start paying tax or have to pay higher rates.\n\nThe freeze means any pay rise would see people paying more tax, with more people dragged into a higher tax band, or having to pay tax on their income for the first time.\n\nReeves has also said there will be a focus on cutting the cost-of-living,\n\nOther priorities set out by the chancellor include reducing NHS waiting lists and the national debt.\n\n, a limit that means parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children.\n\nThere has been pressure from Labour MPs to remove the cap, which was introduced under the Conservatives - a move that could cost more than £3bn, according to estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank.\n\nWhile she refused to confirm the cap would be scrapped, Alexander said tackling child poverty was "in the DNA of the Labour Party".\n\n"One of the defining elements of this government for me is about what we can do to ensure that children\'s chances in life aren\'t determined by the size of their parents\' bank balance," she added.\n\nThe Conservatives have argued against removing the cap, with Stride telling the BBC it was "a matter of fairness" that parents who are on benefits should have to make the same choices about whether they can afford a bigger family as those who are not.\n\nThe shadow chancellor told Kuenssberg: "The big choice at this Budget now is does the chancellor have the backbone to control government spending, particularly in the area of welfare where some of those costs are spiralling out of control, take those tough choices and therefore not have to start putting up taxes again in areas that are going to damage the economy."\n\nHowever, Green Party leader Zack Polanski said scrapping the cap would be a "victory" and it was "outrageous that it\'s taken the Labour government so long to do it".\n\nHe called for the government to "tax the rich", rather than hit "people out of work or working people who are working really hard while their wages aren\'t going up".\n\nLabour MP John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said he hoped Reeves would announce a "redistributive Budget".\n\n"That does mean that the heaviest weight should fall on the broadest shoulders," he told The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4.\n\n"That means tax rises for the wealthiest and for the corporations, and for those who are making massive profits at the moment."\n\nAsked about divisions within Labour, McDonnell said: "We can do what we want in terms of getting stuff through Parliament.\n\n"Yet we seem to be hindered by a lack of direction and some elements of competence as well."\n\nto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 3, 403940), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 3, 403940)}

The announcement also only applies to services run by England-based train operating companies.\n\nRegulated fares include season tickets covering most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel in and around major cities.\n\nTrain operators are free to set prices for unregulated fares, but they typically rise by similar amounts.\n\nThe government said freezing rail fares was intended to "directly limit inflation" by holding down "a major component of everyday costs".\n\nSince 2021, the annual increase has come in March instead of January.\n\nA government source acknowledged it was possible unregulated fares would still rise, but insisted they usually followed regulated fares.\n\nUnregulated fares increased by 5.5% in the year to March 2025, 1.1% above regulated fares - with a total increase in rail fares of 5.1% in that period.\n\nChallenged over whether other ticket prices would rise to compensate for the freeze on regulated fares, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander insisted the policy was "fully funded".\n\nShe told the BBC\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that regulated fares have tended to inform the price of unregulated fares and they normally "track against each other".\n\nPressed on whether the policy would mean the government has less to spend on upgrading the transport system, Alexander said investment in the rail network would be protected "because we recognise that investing in the infrastructure of this country is the right long-term decision".\n\nThe Rail Delivery Group, a representative body made up of the UK\'s rail operators, said the freeze would be "good news for customers".\n\n"We want our railways to thrive, that\'s why we\'re committed to working with government to ensure upcoming railway reforms deliver real benefits for customers," a spokesperson said.\n\nSince 1996, the government has regulated some train fares following the privatisation of British Rail.\n\nThe freeze marks the first point since then that fares will have been frozen, although there have been periods where price increases were below RPI, and a dip in prices following the financial crash in 2010.\n\nThe government estimates that the move will save commuters on more expensive routes more than £300.\n\nThe chancellor said the freeze was being put in place to help ease cost of living pressures, and make "travelling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier".\n\nThe transport secretary said it was part of "wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways".\n\nGreat British Railways is a public body which is in the process of being set up, and is part of the\n\nThe government has said it will take over the running and management of the tracks and trains, "ending years of fragmentation, driving up standards for passengers, and making journey easier and better value for money".\n\nThe government has said part of its plans for the new body is to "gradually move away from annual blanket increases".\n\nLabour said passengers had faced "relentless" fare increases every year under the previous Tory government.\n\nHowever, shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: "In government, the Conservatives kept fares on the right track with below-inflation rises and consistently called for no further hikes to protect hard-working commuters."\n\nLiberal Democrat transport spokesperson Olly Glover welcomed the freeze but said it was "too little, too late for millions of commuters who have faced years of eye-watering price hikes".\n\nHe added: "We need a real long-term plan to deliver a reliable, affordable railway, not just a temporary political fix days before a tough Budget."\n\nMeanwhile, the government\n\nBut it is also possible electric vehicle owners\n\nThe chancellor is expected to set out a range of smaller tax rises in her Budget,\n\n- a move which would have been a clear breach of Labour\'s election promise not to raise "the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax".\n\nHowever, the government has not ruled out\n\n- the level people start paying tax or have to pay higher rates.\n\nThe freeze means any pay rise would see people paying more tax, with more people dragged into a higher tax band, or having to pay tax on their income for the first time.\n\n, a limit that means parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children.\n\nThere has been pressure from Labour MPs to remove the cap, which was introduced under the Conservatives - a move that could cost more than £3bn.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 4, 116743), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 4, 116743)}

By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."\n\nSpeaking to the BBC\'s Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK\'s regulations  have "made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear".\n\nLimitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said.\n\n"Motorways wouldn\'t be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that\'s sort of what we\'re doing in nuclear safety."\n\nThe government is expected to address the report\'s findings later this month in the Budget.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said: "This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance.\n\n"A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."\n\nSeveral major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity.\n\nThe number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world.\n\nThe UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions.\n\nBritain\'s existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024.\n\nThe UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and\n\nwill take several years to come online.\n\nBeyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction.\n\nThe US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme\n\n- now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040.\n\nIn contrast, Germany has\n\n, prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen.\n\nThe development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl.\n\nMike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: "Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology.\n\n"Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 6, 747106), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 6, 747106)}

I had people that had worked for me for seven, eight years, that I had to say, \'I\'m so sorry, I literally can\'t afford to pay you anymore because we\'ve got no business\'.\'\'\n\nDescribing flaws in the furlough system, one Northern Irish contributor said her husband lost his job in the run-up to the scheme coming to an end.

Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.\n\nSo what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?\n\nWe are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.\n\nHowever, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.\n\nAnd, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the "big things" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.\n\nWhen it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.\n\nThe head of the CBI business group, Rain Newton-Smith, has said "stability is the only road to growth" and urged the government not to hit businesses with more taxes.\n\nSpeaking to the CBI\'s annual conference, she said the government needed to make "hard choices for growth now before they get harder, having the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones".\n\n"It means one or two broad tax rises, rather than death by a thousand taxes."\n\nSo what might be in the mix?\n\nBusiness rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.\n\nThe chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses\' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.\n\nBusiness Secretary Peter Kyle addressed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference on Monday, and had a couple of business-friendly policies to announce.\n\nHe pledged to lower electricity bills for 7,000 British businesses, and said the British Business Bank would focus its lending on the eight "high potential" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.\n\nHe told the conference: "Let\'s not kid ourselves — actual growth, real growth, comes from enterprise and wealth creation.\n\n"We will build a pro-business, pro-wealth creation, pro-growth Britain. This week\'s budget will take the fair and necessary choices to embed that further."\n\nThe chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as "probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament", as a way of removing barriers to growth.\n\nBank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative.\n\nIt is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis.\n\nThat in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.\n\nThe oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the "windfall" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.\n\nThe additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.\n\nAmong bosses there is still concern over the government\'s flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one.\n\nRain Newton-Smith told the CBI conference that the government should "change course" on the bill and that businesses were not being listened to.\n\nThere is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.\n\nThe business secretary told the BBC\'s Today programme on Monday that any changes to the law would "be implemented in a way that is benefiting business and benefiting the people who work in business".\n\n"We do not see this as zero-sum," he said.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the bill her speech to the CBI, saying it would allow new hires to lodge claims with an employment tribunal "before they\'ve even worked out where the toilets are".\n\nShe said this would make hiring "riskier, slower and a lot more expensive".\n\nThe chancellor is also expected to speak in the Budget about consumers having the "confidence to spend".\n\nSome in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm\'s wage structure.\n\nOne other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.\n\nSuch schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come.\n\nWhat the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.\n\nAfter months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.\n\nBut confidence is still very fragile.

It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands.\n\nWhen Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved.\n\nEuropean officials have previously said that its digital rules were not up for negotiation.

It\'s often easy to shrug it off, but there\'s a risk.\n\nBeing a victim of a data breach increases your chances of being targeted by criminals and scammers.\n\nSue told the BBC how scammers went after her. We found her details had been leaked online.\n\nShe was a victim of what\'s known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they\'re the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device.\n\nThey used it to take over almost all her online accounts through her phone. She said the experience was "horrible".\n\n"The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks," she said.\n\nSue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers.\n\nIt took several trips to the branches of her bank and mobile phone provider to get her accounts back.\n\nAnd the thieves weren\'t done.\n\n"The criminals also did a sinister thing after breaking into my WhatsApp," she said. "They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses."\n\nWe searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue\'s details were previously compromised.\n\nHer phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Other compilations of hacked records also included her details.\n\nHannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack.\n\n"Once they had access to Sue\'s phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account," she said.\n\nBut scammers aren\'t always targeting big payouts.\n\nFran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account  - and increased her monthly subscription.\n\n"I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn\'t made this purchase," she said.\n\n"I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no."\n\nFran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader.\n\nIt\'s not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed.\n\nBut we found Fran\'s email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com.\n\nThe password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others.\n\n"There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock.\n\n"It\'s a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company\'s data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse."\n\nScammers often combine stolen private information with public information.\n\nLeah, who didn\'t want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam.\n\n"I got a phishing email from \'notifications@facebookmail.com\' saying that I was due a refund. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication.\n\n"They then posted child sexual abuse videos under my name which got me blocked. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta."\n\nIn the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. She eventually got the money back.\n\nAlberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah\'s email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year\'s Qantas (third-party breach).\n\n"It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah\'s private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account."\n\nThey could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said.\n\nMass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone.\n\nAccording to Proton Mail\'s Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed.\n\n"Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks," said Eamonn Maguire from the firm.\n\nAside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims.\n\nOffering free credit monitoring, for example, used to be common.\n\n(which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people.\n\nBut this year fewer firms are doing this. Marks and Spencer and Qantas, for example, have not offered these services to customers.\n\nCo-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops.\n\nSome are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted.\n\nBut some have been successful.\n\nT-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers.\n\nThe firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 14, 708180), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 14, 708180)}

The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response.\n\nThe government is looking at a range of options to help it raise more money.\n\nReeves has confirmed that\n\nAccording to government sources, Reeves has decided not to raise income tax rates, a move that had been widely expected.\n\nHowever, speculation remains that the chancellor could extend a freeze on income tax and NI thresholds beyond the planned 2028-29 deadline.\n\nFreezing thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax and NI. Some people have to start paying higher tax rates.\n\nThe chancellor is planning to raise about £2bn by limiting a tax break on pension contributions,\n\nIt suggested Reeves could put a £2,000 cap on the amount workers can put into their pensions under "salary sacrifice" schemes without paying National Insurance. At the moment there is no limit.\n\nIt would mean that any contributions above the cap would be subject to NI payments by both employees and employers.\n\nFor people receiving the full rate of the new state pension, the chancellor is expected to confirm an increase of more than £550 a year from April.\n\nThis is due to the "triple lock", which means the state pension increases by either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure.\n\nReeves is planning to introduce a new tax on high-value homes in England, both\n\nhave reported. About 2.4 million properties in council tax bands F, G and H will be revalued, they said.\n\nThe tax will apply to properties worth more than £2m, which will affect about 100,000 homes with an average surcharge of £4,500, the Times said.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that more landlords should pay NI. At present, if being a landlord is not your main source of income, you may not pay any.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that all landlords should pay NI at a basic rate of 20% with an additional rate of 8% for property earnings above £50,270 a year.\n\nThe chancellor is considering a new tax on electric vehicles (EVs). This could help make up for the fall in fuel duty as more drivers move away from petrol and diesel cars.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh.\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC: "Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there\'s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers."\n\nThe Budget is also expected to include an extra £1.3bn in funding for the Electric Car Grant scheme, which offers subsidies of up to £3,750 for eligible models.\n\nThe government may limit the tax break that people can get when buying a bicycle through the Cycle to Work scheme, according to reports.\n\nA limit on how much people can spend on a bike through the salary sacrifice scheme could be introduced,\n\nThe scheme offers savings of 42% of the cost of a bike for higher rate taxpayers and 30% for basic rate taxpayers. A previous spending cap of £1,000 was lifted in 2019.\n\nThe chancellor is reportedly planning to cut the amount of money that can be saved tax-free in cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas).\n\nReports have suggested that Reeves could reduce the annual allowance from £20,000 to £12,000.\n\nHowever, cutting the cash Isa limit is unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting investment in stocks and shares, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have said.\n\nThe government is expected to close a tax loophole which UK firms argue gives an unfair advantage to foreign online retailers such as Shein.\n\nAt the moment, overseas retailers can send packages worth less than £135 to the UK without paying import duties, but this would end.\n\nThe TUC, the umbrella group for UK trade unions, has called for\n\nIn September, the chancellor told ITV News that "there is a case for gambling firms paying more".\n\nA so-called milkshake tax has been announced ahead of the Budget.\n\nThe existing sugar tax, which mainly applies to fizzy drinks, will be applied to bottles and cartons of milk-based drinks, including milkshakes, flavoured milk, milk substitute drinks and lattes.\n\nThat could add a few pence to these drinks. Or, as has happened with some fizzy drinks, manufacturers may lower their sugar content to avoid the tax.\n\nThe minimum wage for over-21s will go up by 50p an hour to £12.71 in April 2026, Reeves announced on Tuesday, ahead of the Budget.\n\nFor workers aged 18 to 20, the minimum wage will rise to £10.85, an increase of 85p. The government wants to eventually scrap the separate rate for this age group, creating a single minimum wage for all adults.\n\nFor 16 and 17-year-olds and apprentices, the minimum wage will increase to £8 an hour, up from £7.55.\n\nAfter the minimum wage went up last year, businesses warned that another increase could result in hiring freezes or job cuts.\n\nParents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children. The rule applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.\n\nThe chancellor hinted at changes when she told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were "penalised".\n\nShe could scrap the limit entirely or extend the benefit to all families, irrespective of the number of children, but at a lower level.\n\nThe BBC understands the government could bring down gas and electricity bills by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy, or reducing some regulatory costs which suppliers can pass on to customers.\n\nReeves has said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months\n\nThe chancellor needs more money in order to meet self-imposed rules for government finances which she says are "non-negotiable". The two main rules are:\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government\'s official forecaster - has assessed the gap in public finances to be close to £20bn, the BBC understands.\n\nThe government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority.\n\nA growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.\n\nIn October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that\n\n.

But if you\'re planning to buy now, here\'s how to make sure you bag a bargain.\n\nSome retailers create the illusion of a big discount by raising prices in the weeks before Black Friday, only to drop them again during the "sale".\n\nWebsites such as PriceRunner or CamelCamelCamel let you look at previous prices so you can work out whether a discount is genuine.\n\nFor example, according to Price Runner, the cheapest Apple ipad overall was selling online for £309 on the 19 October. By 10 November it had increased to £391.99. When the Black Friday sales launched on 21 November, it was back down to £309.\n\nThis tactic isn\'t illegal, but it can easily mislead shoppers into thinking they\'re getting a far bigger discount than they really are, consumer champion, Rebecca Wilcox told Morning Live.\n\nAI can help too, says retail analyst Natalie Berg, host of the Retail Disrupted podcast. "You can ask ChatGPT: \'Show me the best Black Friday deals for a 10-year-old who loves the movie Wicked.\' You don\'t need to trawl through different sites, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming."\n\nShoppers often hold off buying items hoping they\'ll be cheaper on Black Friday.\n\nBut none of the 175 products tracked by Which? were at their cheapest price of the year on that day.\n\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth says: "There is a huge risk in [holding out], because the products you want to buy may not be available anymore."\n\nShe says higher costs this year means retailers are less likely to have surplus stock.\n\nSo if you do find the product you\'re after and it\'s at a price you\'re happy with, Shuttleworth recommends buying it - and keeping your receipt.\n\nMany retailers will refund the difference if prices fall again. Some companies, like Currys and Argos, offer a Black Friday guarantee.\n\nIf you do find it cheaper within the returns period you could always take it back it and buy again at the lower price.\n\nDon\'t just think about big-ticket items. Some of the biggest markdowns are on everyday items such as quilted toilet roll and dishwasher tablets, Kat Cereda from consumer watchdog Which?\n\nStart by deciding what you actually need. If you\'re looking for a specific brand, check their website directly and join their mailing list for early access to their sales.\n\n"The tech is there to help retailers offer more real-time rewards and target their best shoppers," says Berg.\n\nDon\'t fall for pressure tactics such as "selling fast" or "only two left", which can fuel impulse buying, the competiton watchdog warns.\n\nAnd if you\'re spending over £100, then it recommends using a credit card.\n\n"You have legal protection that means you can claim for a refund if the company goes bust, your item doesn\'t arrive, or if there are certain other problems such as an item being faulty or not as described," says Hayley Fletcher from The Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nScammers ramp up activity around major events like Black Friday and can take advantage of the urgency shoppers may feel. Fake websites and counterfeit goods often spike during this period, posing as limited-time deals to lure people in.\n\n"If something seems too good to be true or doesn\'t feel right, it might be a scam. Don\'t rush your purchase. Research the company you\'re buying from and be wary of suspicious web links," says Jane Parsons, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.\n\nThis year, TikTok shop has become an increasingly popular destination for Black Friday discounts, with brands such as M&S, L\'Oréal and Rituals selling directly on the app.\n\n"You can find flash sales not available on a retailer\'s site," says Berg.

You can\'t say you like the cola bottles but you don\'t like the fruit salad."\n\n"It all comes together and hangs together as a whole."\n\nShe said her three priorities would be: "Cutting the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and cutting the cost of debt."\n\nFollowing the meeting, one Labour MP said the chancellor had been "strong and honest" but another said she had sounded "desperate".\n\nDespite Reeves\' call for unity, on Tuesday morning three Labour MPs turned up to a protest – also attended by Green Party leader Zack Polanski - urging the chancellor to consider implementing a wealth tax.\n\nAsked why he was attending a protest alongside the leader of an opposition party, Neil Duncan-Jordan said "this is about an issue, not about what label people are wearing".\n\n"My view is we should be taxing those with the broadest shoulders – they should be carrying the heaviest burden."\n\nIn the year since the last Budget, Labour MPs have become increasingly critical of Reeves\'s judgement.\n\nThe chancellor has been forced to make U-turns on some policies, including cutting the winter fuel payment.\n\nThere had also been concerns in the party about suggestions she would use this Budget to raise income tax rates, a move that would have broken the party\'s election manifesto promise.\n\nInstead, it could consider extending the freeze on the levels at which people start to pay income tax and national insurance, meaning more people are drawn into paying more tax on their wages and pensions over time.\n\nThe chancellor could also look at a range of smaller measures to raise money including new taxes on high-value homes in England, electric vehicles and gaming companies.\n\nShe needs to find more money in order to meet her own rules aimed at reducing debt and borrowing, while closing a gap in public finances, estimated to be around £20bn.\n\nOther possible money-raising measures include:\n\nReeves has also suggested she will scrap the two-child benefit cap, which limits the benefits parents can claim for their third child or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.\n\nThe triple lock - which means the state pension increases by either 2.5%, average earnings growth or inflation - is expected to stay in place, while the living wage is likely to rise.\n\nAhead of the Budget, ministers\n\nthat pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes will be subject to the sugar tax.\n\nConservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said he worried the Budget would see "tax on hard- pressed hard-working people being transferred into the benefits system".\n\nSpeaking at a conference on Monday, head of the Confederation of British Industry Rain Newton-Smith urged Reeves not to inflict "death by a thousand taxes" on businesses.\n\nShe said the chancellor should have "the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones".\n\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper accused the government of "rank hypocrisy" over its potential tax plans.\n\n"Rachel Reeves once accused the Conservatives of \'picking the pockets\' of working people by freezing tax thresholds - now Labour plans to do exactly the same," she said.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 18, 728764), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 18, 728764)}

Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with "many" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\n\n"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period," the minutes said. "Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year."\n\nIn Fed parlance, "many" is more than "several," indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, "participants" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it\'s unclear how the voting members\' sentiment is set for a December move.\n\nHowever, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair\n\n\'s post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a "foregone conclusion."\n\n"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee\'s December meeting," the minutes said.\n\nPrevious to Powell\'s statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group\'s FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.\n\nThe minutes did note that "most participants" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.\n\nUltimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.\n\nOfficials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has "shown little sign of returning sustainably" to the Fed\'s 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\n\n"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range," the minutes said.\n\nAt the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how "restrictive" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that "the resilience of economic activity" indicated that policy is not restrictive.\n\nJudging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.\n\nIn between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.\n\nThe minutes noted that "one participant," a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.\n\nThe meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.\n\nPowell compared the situation to "driving in the fog," though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.\n\nThe minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion.

You also have to live in the UK or be a member of the armed forces or a so-called Crown servant who works abroad.\n\nIsas were first introduced by then-chancellor Gordon Brown in 1999, but the annual allowance and the way they work have changed several times since then.\n\nare typically offered by banks or building societies, and function like a normal savings account.\n\nSavers pay in money and interest gets added on top.\n\nWith regular saving accounts, once the interest goes above a certain threshold,\n\nA basic rate taxpayer can earn £1,000 in savings interest a year before paying tax. For higher rate taxpayer the limit is £500, but additional rate taxpayers don\'t have any allowance - they pay tax on all their savings income. Those on low incomes may get an extra allowance.\n\nHowever, when money is saved in a cash Isa, the interest is tax-free, no matter much you earn.\n\nCash Isas are very popular, with millions of savers holding billions of pounds in them.\n\nwork in much the same way.\n\nHowever, instead of simply being held in an savings account, the money is invested in shares in companies, unit trusts, investment funds or bonds.\n\nUnlike other investments, any returns are protected from income tax and capital gains tax.\n\nCrucially, while the returns can be greater, so too are the risks. The amount of money you have in a shares Isa can go down as well as up.\n\nallow young people to save - or let their parents save for them - until they reach 18 - when they can access regular Isas.\n\nare designed to help people save towards a deposit when buying a first home, or for retirement. Savers can put in up to £4,000 a year and the government adds an extra 25%.\n\n, and some savers have fallen foul of property purchase price limits.\n\nlet people use other types of financial arrangements such as peer-to-peer loans, without going through a bank.\n\nReports suggest the chancellor is planning to reduce the annual tax-free allowance in cash Isas to £12,000.\n\nThe government says it wants to "ensure people\'s hard-earned savings are delivering the best returns and driving more investment into the UK economy".\n\nPlans are in place to encourage people with high levels of savings to invest instead.\n\nNew adverts, reminiscent of the "Tell Sid" campaign of the 1980s, which encouraged people to invest in the newly privatised British Gas.\n\nTargeted messages will also be sent by banks to people who have money in low-interest accounts.\n\nIt is thought the government wants to encourage savers to put money into stocks and shares. This could potentially benefit British companies, and boost economic growth in the UK which has been sluggish.\n\nMany investment companies that sell stocks and shares Isas back such a move, while banks and building societies who dominate the cash Isa market are more cautious.\n\nThose in favour say there are billions of pounds languishing in savings accounts, which do not need to be accessed in a hurry.\n\nThey say that savers could benefit, as well as the wider economy, if that money is invested in stocks and shares in the long-term, rather than sitting in savings accounts.\n\nThey want reforms to encourage personal investing.\n\nBy reducing the attractiveness of cash Isas, opponents said there was little evidence that people would shift to stocks and shares Isas instead.\n\nThey warned many people might not save at all, or would simply pay more tax on any money held in non-Isa accounts.\n\nBuilding societies, in particular, pointed out it would also reduce the amount of money they received from savers\' deposits which could then be lent out as mortgages or other loans.\n\nAs a result, the cost of borrowing could rise.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 21, 904264), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 21, 904264)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyx9n5p7v7o', 'title': "Has Britain's budget watchdog become too all-powerful?", 'body': 'These days, however, it\'s a blue book that\'s in the spotlight. Or more precisely, a chunky chart-filled analysis of the Budget, assessing the cost of government policies, published by a team that sits in a far corner of the Ministry of Justice building - one that few people outside this closed world know much about.\n\nYet it\'s also a department that has extraordinary influence over economic policy.\n\nNow a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy.\n\nAnd indeed whether its chairman, Richard Hughes, a Harvard-educated former Treasury mandarin, has in fact become as important as the real chancellor.\n\nLou Haigh, a former Labour Cabinet minister, has called the OBR an "unelected institution dictating the limits of government ambition". And just last week the Trades Union Congress accused the "unaccountable OBR" of being a "straitjacket on growth".\n\nSo, ahead of Wednesday\'s Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog - and if so, could this partly be at Labour\'s own hand for having changed the department\'s role in the first place?\n\nBack in March, just after the Spring Statement, I asked Richard Hughes for his response to the critique that had been prevalent even then that the OBR is all-powerful.\n\nHis answer, tinged with an uncharacteristic air of exasperation, was firm.\n\n"The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament in legislation," he insisted. "And those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of government policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on the course to meet her fiscal rules.\n\n"The chancellor chooses the policies she wants to implement. She chooses the rules she set for herself, and if she wants to change those rules, she can change those rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies."\n\nOfficially the OBR monitors the UK government\'s spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending.\n\nYet the irony in the timing of the questions around its influence is that they follow the chancellor herself giving the forecaster even more independence and authority.\n\nWhat\'s more, she herself appoints, with the consent of the Treasury Select Committee, the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, who lead the OBR.\n\nWhen Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives\' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets.\n\nAt the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration\'s ability to announce those policy changes. The new law ensures this could not happen again.\n\nIt also gives the OBR the ability to question government assumptions about spending by departments, which it did not have before, and provides direct access to Treasury data to help them do this.\n\nEmpowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves\'s plan.\n\nThe Chancellor believed that giving the forecaster more independence and influence would improve credibility in UK tax and spending policy; the memories of the Truss-Kwarteng mini-Budget may well have been front of mind.\n\nAnd yet by September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury\'s own reported frustrations with the OBR were circulating.\n\nWhen I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that "promises made are constantly not kept" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: "The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy."\n\nYet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR\'s true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest.\n\nEven before Labour\'s law change, the then-director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, argued that we should be "highly cautious" about moving towards what he described as a "more powerful fiscal technocracy".\n\n"The OBR has brought discipline and transparency to the fiscal policymaking process, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing," he claimed. "Choices over how much to tax, spend and borrow are not narrow, technical questions.\n\n"They are inescapably political."\n\nAt the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. Productivity plays a key role in long-term growth prospects and therefore can influence Budget decisions.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves\'s Budget black hole.\n\nThis all has knock-on consequences for any chancellor.\n\nFor example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024.\n\nBut the bigger issue is how much credit the government should get for "pro-growth measures", such as planning reform or easier post-Brexit trade terms with Europe. The more this is forecast to help medium-term growth, the smaller the gap in the Budget maths.\n\nSome on the Labour left have identified the OBR as a core structural reason why a government with a massive majority cannot act decisively on its instincts. A version of that view has spread now to some on the Labour right too.\n\nPraful Nargund, director of the Good Growth Foundation, who unsuccessfully stood against Jeremy Corbyn in last year\'s general election, said last week: "The Office for Budget Responsibility was created to enforce austerity. But in its attempt to restore credibility, it has pushed us further down the spending-cut rabbit hole without an end in sight.\n\n"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn\'t built for the task."\n\nBut Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them.\n\nIn late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled "Reconstruction".\n\nBritish building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy.\n\nIt drew little attention, yet it was from this pamphlet that the idea of the OBR was born.\n\nThe office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011.\n\nYet Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was going to cause the coalition government some problems.\n\nTake the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s.\n\nIt prompted my BBC colleague Norman Smith to describe the "road-to-Wigan-pier" style austerity, (a reference to the George Orwell\'s indictment of living conditions in the industrial north of England).\n\nSince then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a "deep state" played a part in bringing down her brief government - "the economic establishment, who fundamentally don\'t want the status quo to change", as she put it.\n\nAs for the OBR, she once said: "Treasury officials go from the Treasury to the Bank of England, to the OBR to the Resolution Foundation. They go to Goldman Sachs, they… it\'s the same people."\n\nDuring the Johnson-Sunak era, the OBR also published charts that the sitting government would not have welcomed, which showed the tax burden reaching post-World War Two highs.\n\nIt is the Labour government that strengthened the OBR - and the distinguished CVs of the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee ensure that it is taken seriously.\n\nRichard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England\'s monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nInsiders have told me there will be important changes to how the dynamic between the OBR and the Treasury will function in future.\n\nIn essence, the OBR\'s judgement of the amount of room for manoeuvre - the so-called "headroom" calculation - will now only be made once a year, from this Budget onwards. So, the tense process of the Treasury waiting on every bit of number crunching from the OBR will happen only in the run up to a full Budget.\n\nIt is a recognition that the current system has led to an ever-spinning hamster wheel of tax rise speculation.\n\nHowever, defenders of the OBR say it is not the fault of the forecaster. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advises the UK that raising the headroom is the best way to stop the doom loop of tax-rise speculation harming consumer and business sentiment.\n\nThe chancellor has all but announced her strategy to increase headroom figures at the Budget. The amount will be closely watched in the markets.\n\nUltimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR\'s role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.\n\nPlus, even if the OBR did not exist, the government\'s Budget decisions would still be constrained by the reaction of markets.\n\nThe UK is, after all, reliant on the "kindness of strangers" - foreign buyers of our debt. As the Chancellor points out now, they are increasingly likely these days to be a foreign hedge fund than a UK pension or insurance company.\n\nSo, those who now want to diminish the role of the OBR, will have to demonstrate alternative and convincing means of proving their own credibility, both on the numbers and on their political authority to drive through policies.\n\nAnd yet other countries do manage without institutions such as this. So, for now, there is a serious debate emerging at this Budget, not just about the Chancellor\'s policies. The role, record, and future of the OBR is definitively in play.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 22, 119212), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 22, 119212)}

The rival bid from Arora Group would have involved a shorter runway at a lower cost, and did not require altering the M25.\n\nA final decision on whether a third runway will get the green light is still years away.\n\nLast month, the government asked for further information to help choose between the Heathrow and Arora schemes.\n\nThe Department for Transport said Heathrow\'s own proposal offered the most deliverable option, and the "greatest likelihood" of getting a decision on planning approval within this parliament.\n\nThe plan that has been backed will inform the government\'s review of the Airports National Policy Statement.\n\nOnce that is complete, Heathrow is expected to apply for planning permission. The government then hopes for a decision by 2029.\n\nBut any company will be able to submit an application to build the new runway and terminals at the site.\n\nin the summer.

I\'m unclear how you get a new runway at Heathrow and it doesn\'t cause environmental damage, noise pollution, air pollution being exacerbated."\n\nIn reaching its decision, the government said that Heathrow\'s runway plan was better developed and, while it required "major works" to the M25, the rival Arora scheme would also have had a "considerable impact" on the motorway.\n\nIt added that while the Heathrow proposal requires more land, it involves the acquisition of fewer houses around the airport than Arora\'s plan.\n\nThe government also said the longer runway would provide "greater resilience and potential futureproofing for next-generation aircraft".\n\nA spokesperson for Heathrow welcomed the decision but said it needed "clarity as to how the crucial next phase of the project will be regulated".\n\nThe airport is seeking reassurance that it will be allowed to increase its fees by enough to cover the cost of the planning application, which it says it will have to start very soon to meet the government\'s timetable.\n\nEarlier this month, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, told industry members and MPs that\n\n"I think we should look at ways of potentially building a shorter runway," he said.\n\nSome airlines are concerned that the cost of building the third runway will make the airport more expensive for them, and ultimately for customers.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 22, 591177), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 22, 591177)}

That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.\n\nThe target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.\n\nThose expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\nHowever, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it\'s been since October 2021.\n\n"All those numbers suggest an economy that\'s still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other," Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don\'t think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other."\n\nTo be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight.\n\n"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate," wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

So the maximum bonus after four years would be £1,200. The account closes after four years and no more can be opened.\n\nThe bonus relates to 50% of the highest amount saved over the first two years, then the second two years. That is designed to prevent people keeping money in the account when it would be better used making a emergency, or debt, payment.\n\nThe scheme will be expanded to an extra 1.5 million savers in 2028 to include universal credit claimants that have children in education or carers that provide 35 hours of care to someone with a disability.\n\nSeparately, the amount of money that can be saved tax-free each year in a cash Isa  is likely to be cut in the Budget.\n\nThe annual allowance is expected to be reduced from £20,000 to £12,000, as the Treasury wants to encourage people to invest instead.\n\nThat could help boost growth, a key objective for the government. But there are questions over whether people would naturally put their money into stocks and shares Isas as a result of the less generous tax break on cash Isas.\n\nAbout a quarter of those who save money into a cash Isa currently save more than £12,000 a year.\n\nRobin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association, which has campaigned against a cut, said: "A cut to £12,000 will not encourage more people to invest but will add unnecessary complexity, particularly around Isa transfers, and risks damaging the overall Isa brand.\n\n"This may also deter people from saving and investing.

It will increase by 6% to £8 an hour in April.\n\ndepending on your age and what stage of your apprenticeship you are in.\n\nApprentices aged 16 to 18 are entitled to the National Minimum Wage rate for that age group which is £7.55.\n\nThis will go up to £8 in April.\n\nThose aged 19 or in the first year of their apprenticeship are paid the same amount.\n\nBut those over 19 - or who have already completed their first year - are entitled to the appropriate National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage rate for their age.\n\nSome workers don't qualify for either the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage.\n\nThis includes the self-employed, company directors, volunteers, members of the armed forces and prisoners.\n\nPeople with disabilities or in long-term unemployment who take part in government work programmes are paid fixed amounts at different stages of the scheme.\n\nThese are less than the equivalent National Minimum or Living rate.\n\nYes. It is a criminal offence if employers don't pay the correct National Minimum and Living Wages to eligible workers.\n\nThe rates apply to staff even if they are not paid by the hour.\n\nIf you think you are being paid wrongly, you can\n\nYou can also get advice from\n\nAny employer not paying the correct amount can be fined by HMRC.\n\nIt said 42,000 workers at companies including British Gas's parent company Centrica, Euro Garages and Holland & Barrett were repaid more than £6m.\n\nThe firms listed were fined up to double the total amount they owed to staff, some for underpayments dating as far back as 2013.\n\nis an unofficial hourly rate of pay which is overseen by the Living Wage Foundation charity.\n\nIt is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over, but is voluntary, and firms can choose whether or not to pay it. The wage increases every October.\n\nAccording to the charity almost 500,000 employees working for more than 16,000 firms receive the voluntary rate of pay.\n\nFrom October 2025, it means workers in London earn at least £14.80 an hour  - the London Living Wage - up by 95p, an increase of 5.3%.\n\nIn the rest of the UK, the rate increased by 85p to £13.45, a 6.7% rise.\n\nThe Living Wage Foundation says the rate is worth £2,418 more per year than the legal minimum wage in the UK, and £5,050 more in London.", 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 29, 876218), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 29, 876218)}

I stand by my analysis. I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron. It is clearly\n\nBurry has repeatedly warned that today\'s AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand.\n\nThe Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron\'s, responded to Burry\'s criticism of Nvidia\'s stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks.\n\n"NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU taxes," the memo said, referring to Restricted Stock Units. "Employee equity grants should not be conflated with the performance of the repurchase program. NVIDIA\'s employee compensation is consistent with that of peers. Employees benefitting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance."\n\nThe memo also disputed Burry\'s claims around depreciation life. To Burry\'s charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia\'s graphics processing units in order to justify runaway capital expenditures, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns.\n\nNvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s, released in 2020, continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics.\n\nThe memo also rejects Burry\'s suggestion of "\n\n," saying Nvidia\'s strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI startups raise capital predominantly from outside investors.\n\nBurry said he believes Nvidia now occupies the same position that Cisco — the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle — held in 1999-2000.\n\nJust as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that "internet traffic doubles every 100 days," today\'s hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter.\n\nThe heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5\n\nof U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry\'s belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity, he said.\n\n"And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it. Its name is Nvidia," Burry wrote.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 30, 147884), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 30, 147884)}

They can feel the party\'s current unpopularity in their bones, in their inboxes and in their conversations with their constituents.\n\n"This is the middle of the end," one tells me, anticipating that this will be Sir Keir Starmer\'s and Reeves\'s last Budget.\n\n"I am on a four-year walk to the guillotine," says another, anticipating defeat at the next general election.\n\nEven the most loyal, the least likely to want to sound negative end up sounding just that privately.\n\nLittle wonder that Reeves has had to say out loud that she looks forward to next year\'s Budget and the one after that - chancellors only ever have to do this when some think that is rather unlikely.\n\nI struggle to find any Labour MPs who will privately attempt to argue the weeks leading up to this Budget have been anything other than a mess.\n\nIt has been sufficiently messy that it has\n\nthe very idea of an annual Budget should be scrapped entirely.\n\nThe relationship between the government and its backbenchers is at best tetchy, at its worst volcanic.\n\nDeep unpopularity in the country and jittery Labour MPs is the prism through which both the countdown to this Budget and its aftermath should be seen.\n\nThe prospect of it going down so badly there was a leadership challenge, possibly before Christmas, is what prompted some of those loyal to the prime minister\n\nThe prospect of mutiny among Labour MPs if the Chancellor had smashed Labour\'s manifesto promise not to put up income tax rates prompted both\n\nWobbly indecision in plain sight is near impossible for Labour MPs to defend.\n\nBut the lack of warmth cuts both ways.\n\n"The Parliamentary Labour Party is sprawling and naïve," one government figure tells me.\n\n"They want to avoid the trade-offs and we have to tell them we\'re in government, you can\'t do that."\n\nThe best Rachel Reeves can hope for is that this is a Budget she can get through without making her and Sir Keir Starmer\'s parlous situation even worse – and that it buys them some time, and some patience, from their own MPs and the country.\n\nBut they both know there isn\'t much patience about.\n\nto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 31, 700817), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 31, 700817)}

The real living wage is currently £13.45 in the UK with a higher rate of £14.80 in London."\n\nMs Chapman noted 16,000 employers had already committed to going beyond the legally required minimum.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on low to middle income households, said the increase for 18 to 20 year olds was "unnecessarily big" and could make it harder for people in that age group to find a job.\n\n"These steep increases risk causing more harm than good if they put firms off hiring and push up NEET [not in education, employment or training] rates."\n\nBut the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said phasing out the separate rate for 18 to 20 year olds was "absolutely the right call".\n\n"With living costs stubbornly high, an above-inflation pay rise will make a real difference to the lowest-paid," said TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak added.\n\n"Young workers have bills like everyone else and deserve a fair day\'s pay for a fair day\'s work. It\'s right they see a larger rise as youth rates are phased out."\n\nKate Nicholls, the chair of UK Hospitality, a trade body which represents more than 700 companies and 123,000 venues in the hospitality industry, called on the chancellor to reduce the industry\'s tax burden "if businesses are expected to sustain this level of annual wage increase".\n\n"Hospitality businesses have reached their limit of absorbing seemingly endless additional costs. They will simply all be passed through to the consumer, ultimately fuelling inflation."\n\nJane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, added every above-inflation wage increase "leads to higher business costs, lower investment and fewer opportunities for individuals".\n\n"There\'s a limit to how much additional cost employers can bear without something having to give," she said.\n\nThe chair of the Low Pay Commission, Philippa Stroud, said it had considered the effect a raise would have on employers.\n\nBaroness Stroud, a Conservative peer, said: "In our discussions this year with workers and employers alike, it has been clear that no one is having an easy time."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 32, 411153), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 26, 2, 14, 32, 411153)}
