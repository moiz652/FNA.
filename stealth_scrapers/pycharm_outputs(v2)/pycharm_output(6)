Why John Williams' remarks matter so much", 'body': 'Communication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.\n\nMessages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.\n\nfrom the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed\'s leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair\n\nand Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.\n\nSo when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a "further adjustment in the near term" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n"There is some ambiguity in the phrase \'near term\' – but its most obvious reading is at the next meeting," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note.\n\n"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other members of the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell\'s sign-off," he added.\n\nWilliams\' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.\n\nThe policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself\n\nOn one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.\n\nWhile Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.\n\nThat\'s particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and\n\n, with futures turning around after Williams\' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group\'s\n\nWilliams likely saved the market Friday from a potential sell-off that appeared to be taking shape, with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming Friday. Major averages vacillated through the morning but were at session highs heading into afternoon trading.\n\n"Williams intervention came after several other Fed speakers indicated reservations about [December] but drew back from categorical statements, perhaps indicating they recognize the [December] struggle was turning into a crisis of governance at the Fed and see the need to give Powell space to make the call," Guha said.\n\nTo be sure, other speakers weren\'t as enthusiastic as Williams.\n\nRegional Fed Presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Lorie Logan of Dallas both voiced hesitation about further cuts. In a CNBC interview, Collins expressed concern about inflation. Logan was even more hawkish, saying she wasn\'t even sure she would have voted for the previous two cuts. Collins votes this year on the FOMC, while Logan gets to vote in 2026.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 10, 22259), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 10, 22259)}

So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."\n\nMuch thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve "lots of nods to his Scottish heritage".\n\nKing Charles III\'s seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.\n\nOfficials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.\n\nSo far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.\n\nThe president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.\n\n"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that\'s been the challenge," one courtier told me.\n\nThe scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It\'s a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)\n\nFor the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.\n\nOne Whitehall source said: "The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it\'s all about TV and this is great TV."\n\nAnother said: "It\'s theatre. It\'s all show. It\'s not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."\n\nLord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK\'s strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world "the fullest honour British protocol allows" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.\n\n"This state visit is not just a UK-US event," he said. "It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.\n\n"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK\'s wider international standing."\n\nMany officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.\n\nThey emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.\n\n"Trump can be quite funny in private," said one diplomat. "He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."\n\nFor the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.\n\nBeyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister\'s country residence at Chequers.\n\nMinisters hope to complete a deal to\n\nand aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.\n\nThe centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\n\nThis was Lord Mandelson\'s priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as "my personal pride and joy", that he claimed would "help write the next chapter of the special relationship".\n\nAll these issues will be portrayed as big domestic "wins" to help promote the government\'s growth agenda.\n\nThe visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.\n\nJeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president\'s thinking.\n\n"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better," Hunt said.\n\n"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."\n\nSophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King\'s College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.\n\n"We are moving into a new phase," she said. "This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."\n\nFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.\n\nThe peer\'s dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein\'s conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.\n\nInstead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?\n\nSome diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.\n\nBut perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.\n\nAccording to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.\n\nIt was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week\'s royal and political ceremonial.\n\nDiplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson\'s departure, saying it is the UK\'s business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.\n\nBut there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.\n\nThe Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: "On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China.\n\n"The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."\n\nPerhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East.\n\nNext week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called "two state solution".\n\nBut the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment "to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism".\n\nThere are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships.\n\nYet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him.\n\nThe government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.\n\nAmid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes?\n\n"The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King\'s letter in the Oval Office," said one royal source.\n\n"They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can\'t in Whitehall.\n\n"The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."\n\nOfficial state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal.

In 2019, he dressed up in a "libertarian superhero" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television.\n\nAccording to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation.\n\nYet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%.\n\nThe UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a "template" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as "my favourite president".\n\nThey will meet in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nForeign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington\'s decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina\'s currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei\'s fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei\'s meeting will hail the deal.\n\nYet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei\'s reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes.\n\n"He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by \'la casta\' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen," says Mercedes D\'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate.\n\nBut, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. "The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste."\n\nMilei\'s critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession.\n\nMilei has created a paradox.\n\nOn paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project.\n\nWith midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains?\n\nAround 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. "We\'re all going backwards economically," he says. "I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees."\n\nFor three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them.\n\nNow, Mr Sobol says he can\'t afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he\'s deciding what his family will have to go without too.\n\nArgentina\'s multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes "daily" closures and job losses.\n\nUnlike Trump\'s approach of raising tariffs to promote "America First", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports.\n\n"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don\'t pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field," Mr Galfione argues.\n\nHe believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. "Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more."\n\nMr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes.\n\nAnd yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines.\n\nIn the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts.\n\nAs well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF.\n\n"The demand for public spending was brutal," argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei.\n\n"Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn\'t recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending."\n\nInflation ate away the peso currency\'s purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight.\n\n"Everything was a huge mess," explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria.\n\n"People felt money slipping like water through their fingers."\n\nFor many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change.\n\nHe went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting \'afuera!\' - \'out!\'\n\nAmong other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices.\n\nHis initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell.\n\nWhen I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher\'s face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was "brilliant."\n\nLast month one British newspaper described Milei\'s own approach as having "echoes of Thatcherism".\n\nMiguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei\'s economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. "When you bear in mind the starting point, that\'s a huge accomplishment," he says.\n\nHe believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less.\n\nBut Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case.\n\nJavier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina\'s Congress.\n\n"Being so detached kind of shields him," Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of "signs of empathy in public life".\n\nOn 7 September Milei\'s party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt.\n\nFinancial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year.\n\nTrump\'s £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D\'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in "people\'s real lives".\n\n"We\'re going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina\'s infrastructure."\n\nSome of Milei\'s supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to "break" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power.\n\n"Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back," says Mr Boggiano. "I think Milei will become a model for other countries."\n\nOthers are unsure. "There is some stability which helps things not to explode," said Mr Cibils. "But I think that stability is also a mirage."\n\nMilei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country\'s reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn\'t crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year.\n\nOne former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei\'s strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can\'t pay its debts.\n\n"If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it\'s a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed," says the economist.\n\nThe left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending.\n\nAs to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for.\n\nMany workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a "normalisation".\n\nBut even as leaders abroad watch Milei\'s experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it.\n\nIf normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the \'macro\' successes.\n\n"He has no political expertise, and I think you need it," Prof Rapetti argues.\n\nStill, he believes it is too early to judge: "We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn\'t finished."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 13, 637429), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 13, 637429)}

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397n3jl3z8o', 'title': 'The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high', 'body': 'That\'s a rise of 134% since 2020, and it\'s up 29% just in the past year.\n\nIn cafes and restaurants it\'s a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ.\n\nOne colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price.\n\nYet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs.\n\nThe public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit.\n\nAll of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again.\n\nPlus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\nIt is a perfect storm.\n\nYet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you\'ll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive.\n\nIt all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?\n\nWhere else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two.\n\nThe US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn\'t taste like turpentine.\n\nOrange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added.\n\nWW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid.\n\nIt was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being "better for your health".\n\nWestern consumption of orange juice surged.\n\nFlash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.\n\nAt an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald.\n\nHis firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine.\n\nToday it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers.\n\nBut prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year.\n\nThis followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.\n\n"Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels," Maxim tells me. "At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo.\n\n"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers."\n\nUntil 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n\nProducers have tried to look beyond South America but it\'s not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil.\n\nMorocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)\n\nEven within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates.\n\nIn a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn\'t, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.\n\nFlorida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening.\n\nOne problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet.\n\n"Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice \'Florida Orange\'," says Maxim McDonald.\n\n"It\'s very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it\'s too expensive."\n\nOne of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes.\n\nTropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it.\n\nOne of Tropicana\'s recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an "essentials" brand of orange juice "blends" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it.\n\nThese developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.\n\nThen there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs.\n\nOranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it.\n\nUS exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to "forgo Florida orange juice".\n\nThe Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices.\n\nIn 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this.\n\nAnd while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.\n\nThen there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures.\n\nThe rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles.\n\nIn August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago.\n\nThough this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice.\n\n"When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years," suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData.\n\nDemand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.\n\nUltimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse.\n\n"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced," says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, "Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers."\n\nOthers in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year\'s high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains.\n\nAs for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it.\n\nIt\'s a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills.\n\nBut the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.\n\nOranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time.\n\n"It might be the retailers didn\'t full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it\'s a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got," says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.\n\nUltimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected.\n\n"What we don\'t know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It\'s difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts."\n\nThere is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?\n\nA 2024 government report on food security noted: "The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood...\n\n"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks."\n\nAnd so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 15, 280945), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 15, 280945)}

I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries," says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. "It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"\n\nThe store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nInstead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street.\n\nMore than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That\'s after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid "challenging trading conditions".\n\nIt does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year.\n\nElsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK\'s biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales.\n\nThese places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops.\n\nSo why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time?\n\nOne thing is clear - we\'re not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed.\n\n"[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops," says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. "[They\'re doing this] by saying, \'These are things I\'m going to buy from you.\'\n\n"They know their prices inside out."\n\nSometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices.\n\nBut that\'s not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition.\n\nAll big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year\'s Budget, but it\'s more difficult when you\'re selling the cheapest products because there\'s less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers.\n\nFor pound shops in particular, it\'s even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn\'t what it used to be.\n\nAfter inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today.\n\nChris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail\'s bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago.\n\nIn 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It\'s now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above.\n\n"We realised the pound game wasn\'t going to work any more," he says. "What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn\'t get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."\n\nBut Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right.\n\nHis Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries.\n\n"We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they\'re going to buy it," he declares.\n\nAs for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can\'t he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers.\n\n"We\'ve got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices," he says.\n\nSo, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of "extra margin".\n\nIf you don\'t get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel.\n\nThe father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later.\n\n"They just didn\'t understand the discount business," he argues. "They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."\n\nWilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nPoundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making.\n\nThe business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices.\n\nIts owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn\'t popular with shoppers.\n\n"Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple," says Catherine Shuttleworth.\n\nBut she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan.\n\nThis has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead.\n\nThe main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then.\n\nBack in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents.\n\nAnd shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains.\n\nDiscount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes.\n\nBy 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car.\n\nBut budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis.\n\nNot only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of "extreme discounting" online to contend with.\n\nToday, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops\' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There\'s also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers.\n\n"AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it\'s growing," says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel.\n\nSales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period.\n\nAmazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul.\n\n"If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you\'d find on Temu etc, so if Amazon\'s doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it\'s notable," says Mr Carroll.\n\n"There\'s a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn\'t slowing down, and I think there\'s much more to come."\n\nThere are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock.\n\n"As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that," she says.\n\n"It\'s not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."\n\nThe danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market.\n\nAll this coupled with a "cost-of-business crisis" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers\' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth.\n\n"You\'ve got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you\'re at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it\'s super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there\'s so many people in that market.\n\n"But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."\n\nIt\'s not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently.\n\nThe Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too.\n\nSavers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland\'s Peckham store space.\n\nOneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs.\n\n"Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."\n\nAs for current trading, he says, he is getting by. "We\'re not saying we\'re earning fortunes of money. We\'re not - but we\'re paying our way, and we\'re just waiting for better times."\n\nHis focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading.\n\n"It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas," he says.\n\nCatherine Shuttleworth reckons that\'s where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. "They\'re a great place to go and deck your house out."\n\nBut also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park.\n\n"For some people, budget shopping is a hobby," she adds, "but for others it\'s an absolute necessity."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 16, 987036), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 16, 987036)}

Or more precisely, a chunky chart-filled analysis of the Budget, assessing the cost of government policies, published by a team that sits in a far corner of the Ministry of Justice building - one that few people outside this closed world know much about.\n\nYet it\'s also a department that has extraordinary influence over economic policy.\n\nNow a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy.\n\nAnd indeed whether its chairman, Richard Hughes, a Harvard-educated former Treasury mandarin, has in fact become as important as the real chancellor.\n\nLou Haigh, a former Labour Cabinet minister, has called the OBR an "unelected institution dictating the limits of government ambition". And just last week the Trades Union Congress accused the "unaccountable OBR" of being a "straitjacket on growth".\n\nSo, ahead of Wednesday\'s Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog - and if so, could this partly be at Labour\'s own hand for having changed the department\'s role in the first place?\n\nBack in March, just after the Spring Statement, I asked Richard Hughes for his response to the critique that had been prevalent even then that the OBR is all-powerful.\n\nHis answer, tinged with an uncharacteristic air of exasperation, was firm.\n\n"The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament in legislation," he insisted. "And those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of government policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on the course to meet her fiscal rules.\n\n"The chancellor chooses the policies she wants to implement. She chooses the rules she set for herself, and if she wants to change those rules, she can change those rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies."\n\nOfficially the OBR monitors the UK government\'s spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending.\n\nYet the irony in the timing of the questions around its influence is that they follow the chancellor herself giving the forecaster even more independence and authority.\n\nWhat\'s more, she herself appoints, with the consent of the Treasury Select Committee, the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, who lead the OBR.\n\nWhen Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives\' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets.\n\nAt the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration\'s ability to announce those policy changes. The new law ensures this could not happen again.\n\nIt also gives the OBR the ability to question government assumptions about spending by departments, which it did not have before, and provides direct access to Treasury data to help them do this.\n\nEmpowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves\'s plan.\n\nThe Chancellor believed that giving the forecaster more independence and influence would improve credibility in UK tax and spending policy; the memories of the Truss-Kwarteng mini-Budget may well have been front of mind.\n\nAnd yet by September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury\'s own reported frustrations with the OBR were circulating.\n\nWhen I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that "promises made are constantly not kept" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: "The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy."\n\nYet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR\'s true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest.\n\nEven before Labour\'s law change, the then-director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, argued that we should be "highly cautious" about moving towards what he described as a "more powerful fiscal technocracy".\n\n"The OBR has brought discipline and transparency to the fiscal policymaking process, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing," he claimed. "Choices over how much to tax, spend and borrow are not narrow, technical questions.\n\n"They are inescapably political."\n\nAt the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. Productivity plays a key role in long-term growth prospects and therefore can influence Budget decisions.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves\'s Budget black hole.\n\nThis all has knock-on consequences for any chancellor.\n\nFor example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024.\n\nBut the bigger issue is how much credit the government should get for "pro-growth measures", such as planning reform or easier post-Brexit trade terms with Europe. The more this is forecast to help medium-term growth, the smaller the gap in the Budget maths.\n\nSome on the Labour left have identified the OBR as a core structural reason why a government with a massive majority cannot act decisively on its instincts. A version of that view has spread now to some on the Labour right too.\n\nPraful Nargund, director of the Good Growth Foundation, who unsuccessfully stood against Jeremy Corbyn in last year\'s general election, said last week: "The Office for Budget Responsibility was created to enforce austerity. But in its attempt to restore credibility, it has pushed us further down the spending-cut rabbit hole without an end in sight.\n\n"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn\'t built for the task."\n\nBut Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them.\n\nIn late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled "Reconstruction".\n\nBritish building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy.\n\nIt drew little attention, yet it was from this pamphlet that the idea of the OBR was born.\n\nThe office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011.\n\nYet Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was going to cause the coalition government some problems.\n\nTake the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s.\n\nIt prompted my BBC colleague Norman Smith to describe the "road-to-Wigan-pier" style austerity, (a reference to the George Orwell\'s indictment of living conditions in the industrial north of England).\n\nSince then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a "deep state" played a part in bringing down her brief government - "the economic establishment, who fundamentally don\'t want the status quo to change", as she put it.\n\nAs for the OBR, she once said: "Treasury officials go from the Treasury to the Bank of England, to the OBR to the Resolution Foundation. They go to Goldman Sachs, they… it\'s the same people."\n\nDuring the Johnson-Sunak era, the OBR also published charts that the sitting government would not have welcomed, which showed the tax burden reaching post-World War Two highs.\n\nIt is the Labour government that strengthened the OBR - and the distinguished CVs of the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee ensure that it is taken seriously.\n\nRichard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England\'s monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nInsiders have told me there will be important changes to how the dynamic between the OBR and the Treasury will function in future.\n\nIn essence, the OBR\'s judgement of the amount of room for manoeuvre - the so-called "headroom" calculation - will now only be made once a year, from this Budget onwards. So, the tense process of the Treasury waiting on every bit of number crunching from the OBR will happen only in the run up to a full Budget.\n\nIt is a recognition that the current system has led to an ever-spinning hamster wheel of tax rise speculation.\n\nHowever, defenders of the OBR say it is not the fault of the forecaster. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advises the UK that raising the headroom is the best way to stop the doom loop of tax-rise speculation harming consumer and business sentiment.\n\nThe chancellor has all but announced her strategy to increase headroom figures at the Budget. The amount will be closely watched in the markets.\n\nUltimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR\'s role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.\n\nPlus, even if the OBR did not exist, the government\'s Budget decisions would still be constrained by the reaction of markets.\n\nThe UK is, after all, reliant on the "kindness of strangers" - foreign buyers of our debt. As the Chancellor points out now, they are increasingly likely these days to be a foreign hedge fund than a UK pension or insurance company.\n\nSo, those who now want to diminish the role of the OBR, will have to demonstrate alternative and convincing means of proving their own credibility, both on the numbers and on their political authority to drive through policies.\n\nAnd yet other countries do manage without institutions such as this. So, for now, there is a serious debate emerging at this Budget, not just about the Chancellor\'s policies. The role, record, and future of the OBR is definitively in play.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 17, 969668), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 17, 969668)}

But he remains actively investing, and he\n\nwhat he sees as the next major mispricing in markets.\n\nCentral to that view is Phil Clifton, Scion\'s former associate portfolio manager, whose research underpins the skepticism. Clifton argues that while generative AI adoption is accelerating, the economics behind the industry\'s massive infrastructure buildout have yet to justify the cost.\n\nIn his farewell letter to Scion investors in late October, Burry called Clifton "the most prodigious thinker" he\'s ever encountered. CNBC obtained several of Clifton\'s research notes from earlier this year, written before he launched his own firm, Pomerium Capital, that help outline Scion\'s bearish thesis on AI.\n\nThe investment world is "expecting far more economic importance out of this technology than is likely to be provided," Clifton wrote. "Just because a technology is good for society or revolutionizes the world doesn\'t mean that it\'s a good business proposition."\n\nOn the surface, AI usage appears ubiquitous. More than 60% of U.S. adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, according to Pew Research Center. Yet Clifton said the economics on the demand side are "surprisingly small."\n\nOpenAI — market leader and cultural phenomenon —\n\nin annualized revenue this year, but that figure is tiny compared with the size of the AI build-out. Hyperscalers have quadrupled their capex spend in recent years to almost $400 billion annually, with expectations of $3 trillion over the next five years, according to Man Group.\n\n"We assume other generative AI services in aggregate are insufficient to justify the sums being spent on infrastructure," Clifton wrote.\n\nScion sees a clear historical parallel with the early-2000s telecom boom, when heavy investment in fiber-optic networks far outpaced actual usage. U.S. capacity utilization fell to about 5%, and wholesale telecom pricing collapsed roughly 70% in a single year, Scion noted.\n\nClifton argues the cloud giants are now in a comparable race, expanding AI infrastructure on the assumption that future demand will catch up eventually. But if mass AI adoption takes longer than expected, the economics on these massive data center deals could become untenable.\n\nSome Big Tech companies are starting to wobble on commitments already, he noted. Microsoft\xa0has canceled data center projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe,\n\n. Alibaba\'s chairman has warned a\n\nNo company has benefited more from AI spending than\n\n. The stock has surged alongside unprecedented GPU orders from cloud providers. But Scion questions whether those customers will ever generate economic returns on that investment.\n\nA key element here is depreciation policy. Tech giants have lengthened server lifespans on the books to six years. Yet Nvidia\'s product cycles run every year now, making older chips functionally obsolete and less energy-efficient, long before they\'ve been written down, Scion claims.\n\nsaying its hardware remains productive far longer than critics say, thanks to efficiencies driven by the company\'s CUDA software system.\n\nStill, Burry and other critics are seizing on a contradiction. Nvidia says the newest chips are superior in performance, efficiency and capability, at the same time as it promises that older chips remain economically viable. One of those defenses, they say, has to give.\n\nto lay out his bearish thesis on AI.

I stand by my analysis. I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron. It is clearly\n\nBurry has repeatedly warned that today\'s AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand.\n\nThe Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron\'s, responded to Burry\'s criticism of Nvidia\'s stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks.\n\n"NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU taxes," the memo said, referring to Restricted Stock Units. "Employee equity grants should not be conflated with the performance of the repurchase program. NVIDIA\'s employee compensation is consistent with that of peers. Employees benefitting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance."\n\nThe memo also disputed Burry\'s claims around depreciation life. To Burry\'s charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia\'s graphics processing units in order to justify runaway capital expenditures, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns.\n\nNvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s, released in 2020, continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics.\n\nThe memo also rejects Burry\'s suggestion of "\n\n," saying Nvidia\'s strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI startups raise capital predominantly from outside investors.\n\nBurry said he believes Nvidia now occupies the same position that Cisco — the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle — held in 1999-2000.\n\nJust as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that "internet traffic doubles every 100 days," today\'s hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter.\n\nThe heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5\n\nof U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry\'s belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity, he said.\n\n"And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it.

Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it.\n\n"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels," says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects.\n\n. It\'s small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways.\n\nNot only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. "If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy," he adds.\n\nAround the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with\n\non their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging.\n\nBut engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects.\n\nA key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid –\n\nto a big connection for powering your trains. "That problem has only become much, much worse," says Mr Murray.\n\nThis is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects.\n\nMr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way.\n\nNow, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain,\n\nfor rail-side renewables projects.\n\n"This is the big one," says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.\n\nNew projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system.\n\nBut for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC).\n\nEfforts are underway in England to develop\n\nthat could solve this problem, though.\n\nSeparately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield.\n\nThe software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation.\n\n"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements," says João Pombo, associate director of the university\'s Institute of Railway Research. "All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August."\n\nBut there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system.\n\nonto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets.\n\n"We eliminate locomotives completely," says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. "Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups."\n\nA key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area.\n\nNevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year.\n\nThese will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. "In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first."\n\nIt would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.\n\nIn the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm\'s wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule.\n\nHe describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – "atomised freight", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be\n\n. "We\'re focused on doing the shorter stuff that they\'re not doing," says Mr Soule.\n\nHe adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. "If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we\'ve doubled the rail industry," he says.\n\nStuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be "quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways".\n\nBut he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the "go-to" option for new railways.\n\n"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case," he says.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 24, 981381), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 24, 981381)}

And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power.\n\nIts mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech\'s current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum\n\nfrom tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.\n\nBroadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate.\n\nPut them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that\'s more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word "might" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters.\n\n"The potential is there, but the jury is still out," he says.\n\n"Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI."\n\nIn terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035,\n\nMeanwhile, AI\'s value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles.\n\n"I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged," jokes Mr Hopkins.\n\nIn mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could\n\nwhile mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.\n\nQuantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the "hallucinations" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error.\n\nThese are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them.\n\nIt\'s tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the\n\nQuantum computers don\'t look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big.\n\nThey exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape.\n\nThey require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It\'s not the sort of thing you\'re likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket.\n\nThey\'re also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature.\n\nThe luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world\'s first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020.  And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.\n\nThese machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn\'t stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential.\n\n"We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives," said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC\'s Tech Life podcast.\n\n"The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI."\n\nProf Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK\'s top quantum experts. "Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds," he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4\'s The Life Scientific.\n\nSo what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they\'re ready?\n\nAs with AI, there\'s a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare.\n\nQuantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers.\n\nTo give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world\'s fastest super computers\n\n- or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete.\n\nHazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that\'s most likely to work for you.\n\nAnd that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers.\n\nQuantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks.\n\nIn 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy.\n\n"The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology," said researcher Ryan Hill at the time.\n\n"A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still.\n\n"Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge."\n\nLast year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a "quantum compass", on the city\'s underground Tube network.\n\nGPS doesn\'t work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather.\n\n"The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication," says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK\'s National Quantum Computing Centre.\n\n"Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems."\n\nThe National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what\'s known as "load shedding" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts.\n\nAnd Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.\n\nSo far, so good – but we also need to talk about secrets.\n\nIt is widely accepted that current forms of encryption – the way in which we store both personal data and official secrets – will one day be busted by quantum technology being able to churn through every single possible combination in record time, until the data becomes unscrambled.\n\nNations are known to be already stealing encrypted data from each other with a view to being able to decode it one day.\n\n"It\'s called harvest now, decrypt later," says Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\n"The theory of how to break current forms of public key encryption await a truly operational quantum computer," he adds.\n\n"The threat is so high that it\'s assumed everyone needs to introduce quantum-resistant encryption now."\n\nThe moment a such a computer exists is sometimes referred to as Q-day. Estimates of when it might arrive vary, but Brian Hopkins at Forrester says it could be soon - around the year 2030.\n\nCompanies like Apple and the secure messaging platform Signal have already rolled out what they believe to be post-quantum encryption keys, but they cannot be applied retrospectively to current data encrypted in the traditional way.\n\nAnd that\'s already a problem. In October, Daniel Shiu, the former head of cryptographic design at GCHQ, the UK\'s intelligence, security and cyber agency, told the Sunday Times it was "credible that almost all UK citizens will have had data compromised" in state-sponsored cyber attacks carried out by China – with that data stockpiled for a time when it can be decrypted and studied.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 26, 673854), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 26, 673854)}

I have," says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. "I wouldn\'t recommend it," he adds, however. It\'s very salty, apparently.\n\nBut this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests.\n\n, two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed.\n\nWhat is Burnblock exactly? No-one will say. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock\'s website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is "a natural component in the body" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and "a natural component in some berries".\n\nFlame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries.\n\nBut many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century\n\n. "There hasn\'t been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them," says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US.\n\nWhen you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. "It also releases some water," he adds. "That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire\'s spread." And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. You can add Burnblock to other building materials, he says, including dried seagrass.\n\nHalt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels.\n\n"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire]," says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – "No" is the answer.\n\nIn one of Halt\'s buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. The top one is a tank containing the treatment fluid that I saw earlier. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood\'s pores, says Mr McCann.\n\nThen, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid.\n\n"What that pressure is doing is, it\'s forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber," says Mr McCann.\n\nAfter this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It\'s carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood.\n\n"Timber is an amazing material," says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. He refers to wood\'s ability to take up treatment fluids within its pores. "You can ultimately change the chemistry of its burning behaviour," he says.\n\nHull is often sceptical of new flame retardants, however. He points out that some ideas have come and gone. "There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s," he says. "Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out."\n\nWhile timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains.\n\nDr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, "solid gasoline" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly.\n\nIn Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm\'s solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry.\n\nFirst Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood.\n\nCould graphene affect people\'s health following a fire? A spokeswoman says, "There\'s no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects."\n\nIn the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards.\n\nExperiments suggest that the graphene does reduce the plastic\'s ability to burn. "It hits the highest ratings in those tests," says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer.\n\nBuildings aren\'t just at risk from fires that start inside them, though. "\n\n," says Dr Morgan. That\'s why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage.\n\nProf Appel hopes to test the substance on mini structures, or mock-built homes, soon.\n\nLab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire.\n\n"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, \'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this\'," recalls Prof Appel.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 29, 889915), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 29, 889915)}

They\'re decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use.\n\nWelcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI.\n\nTraditionally advertisers on social media could target people by the demographic segment they were deemed to fit into - for example, if you\'re a student in Edinburgh or a 35-year-old woman who likes yoga. Ads would "follow" you around the internet based on what you\'d been searching.\n\nBut using the ability of AI to draw on vast quantities of data, companies like Cheil UK can create thousands of different ads that are tailored to different personalities and personal situations. The aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them, down to the tone, phrasing, music and colours used.\n\nTo do that Cheil UK has been working with start-up Spotlight on an AI platform. To get extra layers of information they ask large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, lots of questions about a particular brand to find out what people are saying about it on the internet.\n\nFrom those answers they might, for example, be able to create an ad that not only suits a 35-year old woman who likes yoga, but also one that has just been on holiday or was about to get married.\n\n"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level," says Mr Camacho.\n\n"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that\'s when you start to build a picture to understand that individual."\n\nAn added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output.\n\nResearchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes.\n\nThe study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn\'t mind that it had been written by AI.\n\n"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it\'s still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile," explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University\'s Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research.\n\n"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done]," he adds.\n\nPersonalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising \'wastage\' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go.\n\n"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they\'ve already forgotten it," says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible.\n\n"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop."\n\nIvan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way.\n\n"There\'s also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with," says London-based Mr Mato.\n\n"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn\'t whether brands can personalise everything - it\'s whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do."\n\nAI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges.\n\n"There\'s going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there\'s going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths," he says.\n\n"And that\'s the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next.\n\nBut Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics.\n\n"We don\'t have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We\'re trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We\'re trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that\'s all we\'ve ever tried to do."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 30, 579384), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 30, 579384)}

It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine.\n\nBefore Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements.\n\nNow, she makes drones for use against the Russians.\n\n"It was just an obvious decision for me," she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. "I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."\n\nMs Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed.\n\n"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones," she recalled. "So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."\n\nThese days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon.\n\nCombat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact.\n\nBefore 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones.\n\n"This has been the first full-blown drone war," says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare.\n\n"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They\'ve become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."\n\nAnd not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power." Ms Pettyjohn says.\n\nThe world\'s biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has\n\nsince Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Europe, Portugal\'s Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany\'s Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due\n\nin Swindon in southwest England at the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be\n\non new military drones.\n\n"The sector is growing really quickly," said Mike Armstrong, Stark\'s managing director for the UK. "I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we\'ve seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."\n\nThe growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down.\n\nAnti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport.\n\nOleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company.\n\n"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones," he says.\n\nSince 2022, DroneShield\'s share price has\n\n"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us," Mr Vornik adds.\n\nAs well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China\'s use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs.\n\nMunin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army.\n\n"We\'re building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones," he says. "It\'s a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it\'s coming in."\n\nExperts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger.\n\nBut Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. "That is going to be the next real shift.\n\n"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."\n\nIn the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line.\n\n"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course," she says. "A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers.\n\n"But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 32, 35934), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 32, 35934)}

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.\n\nCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.\n\nIt is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.\n\nHe admits that in the past few months "there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here".\n\nThis conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.\n\nTo get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.\n\nBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.\n\nThis resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.\n\nA number of local people, who didn\'t want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.\n\nAlthough Consettur\'s licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.\n\nIt\'s a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\n\n"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here," he says. "This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."\n\nThese partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.\n\nMeanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.\n\nAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.\n\nSpeaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: "We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."\n\nHer friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site "was a nightmare for us". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren\'t doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.\n\nThe mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\n\n"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."\n\nHe wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.\n\nOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that "more needs to be done for the local communities".\n\nShe adds: "We don\'t have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."\n\nCarlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\n\n"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country," he says. "If we don\'t have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can\'t be competitive in the long term."\n\nHe also wants to change tourists\' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\n\n"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area," says Mr Gonzalez. "And let\'s not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."\n\nBut he says that Peru\'s unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\n\n"I\'ve been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."\n\nBack in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he\'d be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\n\n"If they are given the final approval we don\'t have a problem with working with them.

But it\'s also the toughest crop a farmer can cultivate," says Stanley Pothan, who has been farming cardamom in the southern Indian state of Kerala for decades.\n\nPrized for centuries for its complex, aromatic flavour, cardamom is fiendishly difficult to grow.\n\n"Cardamom is a very delicate plant - prone to diseases and pest attacks. You have to be constantly in the field, watching every leaf, every flower. It demands attention every single day," says Mr Pothan.\n\nIt\'s also extremely sensitive to weather conditions.\n\n"Last year\'s summer was brutal - we lost a significant portion of our crop to the heat. Guatemala, the world\'s largest cardamom producer, lost almost 60% of its crop that season, and we too suffered badly here in Kerala," he adds.\n\nThat poor harvest contributed to a 70% jump in cardamom prices last year to 1,178 rupees (£10; $13) per kilo, up 70% compared to the previous year, according to figures from India\'s Spice Board.\n\nCardamom has always been expensive, usually the third costliest spice by weight, after saffron and vanilla.\n\nFarmers would be keen to raise their output, but it\'s not easy.\n\n"One bad summer or unexpected rain can wipe away the entire effort. That\'s the harsh reality of cardamom farming," says Mr Pothan.\n\nThe government-funded Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI) is trying to ease the burden of tending to cardamom\'s needs.\n\n"Our focus is on crop improvement, pest and disease surveillance, soil management, capacity building, and technology transfer related to cardamom," says Dr A B Reema, Director of the ICRI, which is part of the government\'s Spices Board of India.\n\nOne of its tools is an app that farmers can use to monitor the health of their soil and gives them tailored recommendations on how to best manage it.\n\n"Technology is no longer separate from farming. It is now a daily tool for cardamom growers, from checking soil health on an app, to monitoring rainfall and disease alerts on their phones," says Dr Reema.\n\n"Even small farmers today are using digital tools. They don\'t have to depend only on local advice, they can check the soil quality, moisture, and even disease symptoms right from their field."\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are looking for hardier cardamom varieties.\n\n"We are mainly focusing on developing cardamom varieties that are tolerant to major diseases and pests, while also being high yielding and climate resilient," says Preity Chetty, assistant professor at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Kerala Agricultural University.\n\nThey have made one breakthrough, by finding a cardamom variety that can grow with limited water.\n\nThe researchers are also delving into the genetic make-up for cardamom to find genetic markers for desirable traits. That knowledge should speed up the breeding of more productive plants.\n\n"Unlike other spices, studies on cardamom are limited, especially at the molecular level. There\'s a lack of molecular markers for reproductive or yield traits, which we are now trying to address," says Dr Chetty.\n\nOne key process in cardamom farming is drying the pods once they have been harvested.\n\nTraditionally only the larger farms could afford to set up their own dryers, often fueled by wood.\n\n"Smaller farmers had to depend on middlemen or neighbours for drying, which often affected the quality," says Annu Sunny, who founded the social enterprise, Graamya, in 2016 to help farmers in Kerala.\n\n"As cardamom is the queen of spices and a cash crop lot of people have started get in to cultivation," she says.\n\n"It\'s a very tricky crop. It takes 10 to 12 years to really understand cardamom, how it behaves, what it needs, when to act and when to wait. Every season is like a new experiment," she adds.\n\nTo help farmers with the drying process, Graayma has introduced heat-pump dryers.\n\nGraayma charges 10 rupees per kilo, which is significantly cheaper than wood drying which cost around 14 rupees per kilo.\n\n"The finish of the product is much better, there\'s no smoke, no uneven heating, and the pods retain their natural green colour. That\'s very important because colour decides the price."\n\nGrowing cardamom with the help of fertilisers and pesticides is hard enough, but some farmers are going a step further, by taking an organic approach to cultivation.\n\n"When I first started, I had no idea what I was getting into," says Mathews Geroge, formerly a banker who turned to farming in Kerala in 2020.\n\n"When I first spoke to scientists at the Cardamom Research Institute, they discouraged me. They said cardamom is too sensitive and difficult to grow organically."\n\nInitially they appeared to be right - around 90% of his first crop was destroyed by pests and local traders rejected his cardamom because, to them, it looked in poor condition.\n\nAfter two years of experimentation he turned to the ancient Indian cultivation methods of Vrikshayurveda, which he says has bought more success. But it\'s still not easy.\n\n"Even today, I wouldn\'t say I\'ve mastered cardamom farming. It\'s still a challenge. Some seasons are good, some aren\'t. But now I understand the rhythm of the crop - when to act, when to wait, when to let nature do its job."\n\nUltimately, Mr Geroge thinks organic farming will be able to compete with traditional methods.\n\n"Sustainable farming begins with reducing input costs. Many farmers think organic means expensive, but if you make your own inputs and understand your soil, you can actually earn better with less dependence on chemicals."\n\nOne aspect of cardamom farming that is unlikely to change soon is the need for skilled workers.\n\nMr Pothan estimates that labour accounts for 75% of his costs and most of that is spent at harvest time.\n\n"Harvesting is a skilled job - mostly done by women. They know exactly which capsule is ready and which isn\'t. They may pluck one or two from a bunch and return to the same plant after 45 days for the next round. That\'s why it\'s so labour-intensive," Mr Pothan says.\n\nMs Sunny says those jobs are likely to be secure.\n\n"Mechanisation in cardamom is limited. You can mechanise spraying or de-weeding, but not pruning or harvesting. Every innovator who visits our farm looks at cardamom and says \'we\'ll solve this\'. But nothing concrete has come out yet."\n\nMr Pothan agrees and adds that cardamom demands more than just good process.\n\n"In cardamom, there\'s no shortcut. You can\'t automate everything. It\'s one of those crops that needs both science and soul."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 34, 646517), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 34, 646517)}

"Then the town grew and passed us by."\n\nFuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo\'s population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022,\n\nIn addition, Añelo sees some 15,000 workers enter the town each week day.\n\nThis has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through.\n\nLast year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez\'s workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.\n\nAñelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn\'t until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.\n\nFracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.\n\nThe first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina\'s majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.\n\nBy February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.\n\nThis accounts "for more than half of Argentina\'s oil and gas production", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.\n\nHe adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.\n\nNicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. "We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin," he says. "All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."\n\nThe oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.\n\n"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn]," says Mr Gadano. "This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."\n\nMr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports "is very important" for the country, "especially when two or three years ago we were in the red". Yet he adds that it won\'t be "the panacea" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.\n\n"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy," he says.\n\n"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."\n\nOther commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina\'s bad credit rating is putting off international investors.\n\nThey also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.\n\n"Companies say \'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven\'t been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force\'," explains Mr Gadano. "That\'s not how the world works, that\'s not how companies work, especially the big international players."\n\nThe government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party\'s victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.\n\nOther critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.\n\nGustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government "is doing what it has to do and what it can do".\n\nWhat continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. "All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow," notes Mr Gadano.\n\nThis consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.\n\n"We are really losing in the public debate," says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. "There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."\n\nBack at Mr Jiménez\'s garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. "When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."\n\nYet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country\'s problems. "Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 37, 102281), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 37, 102281)}

Building roads, building homes, getting spades in the ground and cranes in the sky," she said.\n\nWhen an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to create more jobs or give pay rises and workers have more cash to spend.\n\nAs a result, more tax is paid to the government, which can be used to increase funding to public services, such as schools, hospitals and the police.\n\n"While the government places growth at the heart of its ambitions, the factors driving that growth may be out of the government\'s control, decided by the, largely unknowable, impact of new technologies," said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG.\n\nfor publishing its growth forecast in error ahead of the chancellor delivering her Budget on Wednesday. Reeves said the mistake was "deeply disappointing".\n\nThe downgrade in growth was a result of the OBR lowering its expectations for the UK\'s productivity by 0.3 percentage points.\n\nThe forecaster also said expected economic rebounds following shocks in recent years, such as the Covid pandemic and energy price crisis, had "not materialised".\n\n"This decision is not a reflection of any particular government policies," it added. "It is based on our latest assessment of the UK\'s productivity performance in historical and international context."\n\nThe watchdog said, in isolation, the reduction in productivity growth could have lowered government revenues by about £16bn in 2029-30, but was offset by a boost in revenues for the Treasury due to higher inflation, wages and increased VAT receipts.\n\nThe chancellor\'s main tax revenue raiser in the Budget was extending the freeze in income tax thresholds for a further three years from 2028.\n\nThe freeze in thresholds is forecast to result in 780,000 more income tax basic-rate taxpayers, 920,000 more people paying the higher rate, and 4,000 more paying the additional rate in 2029-30.\n\nThe OBR highlighted that the tax burden on the economy would hit record levels by the end of the parliament, with an increase of £26bn by the 2029-30 financial year.\n\nHowever, it added public spending would increase in every year and by £11bn in 2029-30, primarily to pay for "reversals to welfare cuts and lift the two-child limit in universal credit".\n\nAs a result of the measures announced on Wednesday, the chancellor doubled the buffer against her fiscal rules to about £22bn.\n\nReeves has two main fiscal rules:\n\nSuch rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets.\n\nReeves has been keen to stress her rules are "non-negotiable" in an effort to assure the markets, who pay close attention to the OBR\'s assessment of the government\'s policies.\n\nBut while forecasts are taken seriously, they are only a best estimate of what might happen in an uncertain world, meaning they are often wrong - hence the revisions in this Budget from the Spring Statement.\n\nFollowing the early publication of the OBR\'s report, there was a brief spell of volatility in the UK bond market before gilt yields - which give an indication of government borrowing costs - fell back to below the level they had been before the leak.\n\nThe OBR said it expects the rate of inflation to be 3.5% this year - which is slightly higher than its previous estimate of 3.2%. It expects the rate to fall further over the coming years towards the Bank of England\'s 2% target.\n\nInflation, which measures the pace of price rises, is expected to have peaked at 3.6% in the year to October.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 41, 283292), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 41, 283292)}

It recognises that the introduction of the tax "may increase the likelihood of motorists choosing to clock their vehicles", and said it was looking at ways to mitigate this.\n\nThe government is now consulting on exactly how the scheme will work.\n\nAccording to the OBR, the new per-mile charge is expected to bring in £1.1bn in the 2028-29 financial year, rising to £1.9bn by 2030-31.\n\nHowever, the amount of money it actually raises will depend on how many people buy electric cars over the next five years, with the report adding the yield "is uncertain".\n\nThe tax applies to UK-registered EVs, regardless of where in the world the vehicle is driven.\n\nEVs registered abroad but are driven in the UK are exempt from the charge.\n\nAll new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force. But some in the industry argue this new tax could make electric cars less appealing.\n\nThe OBR said the new charge was "likely to reduce demand for electric cars as it increases their lifetime cost".\n\n"To meet the mandate, manufacturers would therefore need to respond through lowering prices or reducing sales of non-EV vehicles," it added.\n\nOverall, the charge is forecast to result in about 440,000 fewer electric car sales, though other government policies could help offset around 320,000 of those.\n\nUnder the Vehicle Excise Duty, which became payable on EVs for the first time this year, a tax for people buying luxury electric cars will rise in April 2026 from £425 to £440 per year for vehicles costing more than £50,000 - an increase from the previous £40,000 threshold.\n\nFuel duty has not risen since April 2010.\n\nHowever, from September the 5p cut will be "reversed through a staggered approach", the OBR has outlined.\n\nThe RAC\'s head of policy, Simon Williams, said the fuel duty freeze was a "relief" but it would be "very short-lived given the staggered increase from next September".\n\n"Without the discount, drivers would still be paying more for a litre of petrol than they were prior to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which sent pump prices rocketing to record levels."\n\nHe said a new "Fuel Finder" tool, launching in early 2026, would be a big help for motorists making it easier for them to compare fuel prices at different petrol stations.\n\nStephen Walton, 46, in Crewe bought an electric car for his wife in July 2023 because "she wanted to do what\'s right by the environment".\n\nHe said he now thought owning an EV "just doesn\'t make financial sense" given the higher purchase price and more rapid depreciation levels, adding that a pay-per-mile tax "will literally be the final straw".\n\n"It\'s just a nightmare," he said. "I\'ve paid more to do the right thing and I\'m being penalised for it.\n\n"This will be my first and last electric vehicle because there are no fiscal perks to being an EV car driver."\n\nCar manufacturer Ford and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) industry body both said the new tax was "the wrong measure at the wrong time".\n\nFord said the Budget had conveyed "a confusing message" in the government\'s attempt to get motorists to switch to electric vehicles.\n\nThe SMMT welcomed the government\'s pledge to invest £1.3bn to encourage EV use but warned the pay-per-mile charge would "undermine demand".\n\nThe Renewable Energy Association described the tax as a "knee-jerk" charge.\n\n"The fairest approach would be for all types of vehicles to be included – and this should reflect the environmental impact of their vehicle - in principle, polluters should pay and a higher impact should be reflected in increased costs," said Frank Gordon, head of policy at the group.\n\nDelvin Lane, chief executive of InstaVolt which develops and installs chargers, said the tax could discourage people from switching to electric cars.\n\nHe said drivers without home chargers were already paying more in tax for public charging, and rural and low-income drivers would be disproportionately affected.\n\n"We urge the government to work closely with the charging and automotive sectors to co-design a fair, future-proof system that maintains incentives to switch to zero-emission vehicles while ensuring sustainable road taxation."\n\nEdmund King, president of the AA, said: "The Budget has put drivers at a fork in the road with the chancellor announcing major tax proposals for EV owners.\n\n"Drivers fully understand that the government needs to get the balance right between raising cash for roads investment, whilst ensuring it doesn\'t slow down the transition to electric cars in order to meet environmental targets."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 41, 421557), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 41, 421557)}

Workers "sacrifice" a higher salary, but receive a tax-free sum into their pot, with each pay cheque.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the current system favoured high-income earners and those who work in financial services, "who can put their bonuses into pensions tax-free".\n\nThe £2,000 cap on salary sacrifice was a "pragmatic step", Reeves said, and would mean low and middle-income earners could continue to use the scheme "without paying any more in tax".\n\nThe salary sacrifice policy also reduces the overall amount of employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) that companies pay, so any cap will mean a higher NICs bill for companies or a rethink on whether they offer the perk.\n\nThe cap will mean salary sacrifice contributions above £2,000 will incur NICS for both staff and companies. Workers paying income tax at the basic rate will pay NICS at a rate of 8%, while higher rate taxpayers will pay 2%. Employers pay NICs at a rate of 15%.\n\nAbout a third of private sector employees and a tenth of public sector workers use a salary sacrifice scheme for their pension savings. Analysis by HM Revenues & Customs suggested about 7.7 million employees used it in 2024.\n\nFormer pensions minister Steve Webb, now partner at LCP, said that the time until National Insurance payments are due on salary sacrifice, more than three years away, means it is unlikely the chancellor will raise the £4.7bn the OBR estimates.\n\n"The decision not to implement this change until 2029 creates a huge opportunity for firms to restructure the way that they offer pay and pensions in order to mitigate or eliminate this new charge," Mr Webb said.\n\n"There is a high probability that this policy will only raise a fraction of the amount expected by the chancellor."\n\nBaroness Ros Altmann, also a former pensions minister, said the current salary sacrifice system was "opaque" because it is based on agreements between individual companies and workers to each reduce their tax liability, but the proposed changes "will add to that".\n\n"There\'ll be extra National Insurance costs for employers, lower take-home salaries potentially and then there\'s the administration costs of any change in pension policy.\n\n"Employers may just think the administration costs of changing this isn\'t worth it and scrap the whole thing," she added.\n\n"Overall, I\'d say this is a net-negative in terms of getting the UK saving more."\n\nOthers in the pensions industry suggested the removal of the tax break could lead to companies reducing planned pay rises and contributing less to pensions overall.\n\n"Expect to see employers reining in their contributions," said Alex Foster, a Partner at Blick Rothenberg.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 43, 839423), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 43, 839423)}

Still, the Budget is likely to push up your tax bill before the end of this parliament.\n\nThat\'s because the chancellor has opted to freeze tax thresholds - the point at which you start to pay tax, and the point where you tip into paying a higher rate of tax - for another three years.\n\nThis is often dubbed a stealth tax because, unlike raising the headline rates, it is not obvious on your payslip.\n\nIt will hit you hardest if your income is close to one of the tax thresholds, but anyone who gets a pay rise will be affected, as long as you earn enough to pay tax.\n\nAbout a million people\n\nwho currently don\'t earn enough to pay income tax will be drawn into paying tax as soon as their earnings inch above the £12,570 threshold.\n\nThat will include people living on the state pension, which is currently just under £12,000 a year but is set to rise to very close to the threshold next year. A part-time minimum wage earner, working just 18 hours a week will also pay income tax, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank.\n\nThe personal allowance threshold is set for the whole UK, so people in Scotland will also be affected, although other\n\nPeople will also pay more in National Insurance Contributions (Nics) as the threshold for starting to pay this is also being frozen.\n\nWages usually go up year-on-year to cover the rising cost of living. Normally tax thresholds would also be lifted in line with rising prices.\n\nHowever, due to the thresholds being frozen, as your pay rises, a bigger proportion of it will end up above the threshold and so being taxed.\n\nFor example, if you work full-time and are paid the minimum wage, by 2030 you will pay £137 per year more in tax than if those thresholds had moved higher after 2028, according to the IFS.\n\nAs incomes rise, frozen thresholds also mean more and more people will be dragged into the higher, 40%, tax bracket.\n\nFor example, if you currently earn £49,000 and your pay rises with inflation, by 2031 you could be earning £54,000, meaning some of your income will be taxed at the higher rate which is applied to earnings over £50,271.\n\nAlmost one in four taxpayers will pay some of their tax at the higher rate by 2031, according to calculations by the government\'s independent forecaster.\n\nThe same principle applies to the additional, 45%, rate, that is charged on a person\'s income over £125,140, which 600,000 more people are now expected to pay.\n\nTaxpayers are already paying hundreds of pounds more than they would have if thresholds had been allowed to rise with prices since 2021, when they were frozen by the previous government.\n\nInflation has been high in recent years, making the impact of frozen thresholds bigger.\n\nAfter a decade of frozen tax thresholds, in 2031, the policy will have raised £56bn in total, £12bn from the three-year extension just announced. That\'s money that helps pay for the NHS, schools and support for the sick, disabled and the elderly.\n\nAs things currently stand, thresholds are expected to start rising again in 2031.\n\nHowever, there is no fundamental principle at stake, no size that is the "right" size for the tax free personal allowance.

It also says the threshold for higher, advanced and top bands will remain unchanged, meaning more people will pay a higher rate as their wages increase.\n\nRobison said: "Well in Scotland, of course, a majority of taxpayers do pay less than in the rest of UK, and that\'s a position we want to maintain.\n\n"But we have asked those who earn more to pay a bit more, because we believe in that collective position that if you believe in society, then people have to make a contribution.\n\n"And we believe those with the broader shoulders should make a bit more of contribution."\n\ncautions that difficulties in measuring income and tax figures mean it cannot provide a "definitive" answer about whether more Scots pay income tax than they would elsewhere in the UK.\n\nWhen considering gross figures, it said the majority of Scottish taxpayers have been paying more income tax than they would have if they had lived elsewhere in the UK in each of the past two financial years.\n\nBut it also provided net figures which indicated the opposite.\n\nFor 2025-26, the SFC estimated that a majority of Scots would pay less income tax than they would elsewhere in the UK under both gross and net figures.\n\nthat she may have to revisit her tax plans if Reeves hiked rates south of the border.\n\nThe chancellor had hinted at that possibility before U-turning.\n\nAlthough such a hike would not directly affect Scotland, it would lead to an automatic cut in the Scottish Budget under devolved funding arrangements - leading to warnings of a potential income tax rise north of the border.\n\nInstead, the chancellor announced an extension to a freeze on UK income tax and National Insurance thresholds until 2031.\n\nRobison said that would not affect the Scottish Budget for 2026-27, which is due to be announced on 13 January.\n\nThe finance secretary described the UK Budget process as "chaotic" following weeks of speculation and a series of leaks.\n\nShe added: "But now we\'re back to a bit more certainty then, of course, we want to return to position of our tax strategy."\n\nReeves acknowledged that her tax and spending plans - including changes to cash Isas and levies on pensions - would "impact on working people".\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio Scotland Breakfast that the changes were "fair".\n\nThe chancellor has also been\n\n, who had called for a 78% levy on North Sea oil and gas profits to be lifted.\n\nReeves said the UK Budget would deliver an extra £820m to the Scottish government in the coming years.\n\nShe added: "But money always has to come from somewhere, and it is right that we ask the energy companies to make a fair contribution to fund public services in Scotland."\n\nAt First Minister\'s Questions at Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay said the SNP had broken its\n\nnot to increase income tax, adding that John Swinney "cannot be trusted" not to hike rates.\n\nHe called for the funding the Scottish government had set aside to mitigate the two-child benefits cap - which the UK government has now announced it will scrap - to be used to cut income tax, arguing that workers deserved to keep more of their "hard-earned money".\n\nThe abolition of the cap is expected to save the Scottish government about £120m in 2026-27.\n\nSwinney told Findlay that ministers had to be mindful of the economic context when making decisions on tax, citing the war in Ukraine and the "utter stupidity" of the\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told MSPs that the UK Budget would deliver "the greatest reduction in child poverty from a single budget this century", while also pointing to a rise in the minimum wage.\n\nSwinney welcomed the abolition of the two-child cap, but said the Labour government had to be "shamed into action".', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 49, 986440), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 49, 986440)}

But at 58, he is concerned about retiring.\n\nHe said he was disappointed that the amount of money that can be saved tax-free each year in a cash Isa (Individual Savings Account) will be reduced from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for the under-65s.\n\n"That\'s a big blow for me because I\'m a saver and I\'m coming up to retirement," he says, adding he feels penalised for putting money away for a more comfortable retirement.\n\n"The message I got was: spend your money, don\'t worry about the future," he says.\n\nNeal feels the Budget had been sold as measures to tackle the cost of living but says, "I can\'t see the cost of living reducing for me, only increasing.\n\n"There will be less in my pocket than there was yesterday."\n\nAccording to EY, Neal and Tara would pay a combined £3,485 more in income tax between 2028 and 2031 if their salaries rise in line with inflation, due to the extension of the freeze on tax thresholds.\n\nKat Watkins lives in Swansea and works for Disability Wales.

"We need to get to the bottom of what exactly happened."\n\nMr Hughes said Professor Ciaran Martin, a former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, would provide "expert input" for the OBR\'s investigation.\n\nThe BBC was able to access the PDF version of the OBR\'s key report at 11:45 on Wednesday by replacing the word \'March\' with \'November\' in the web address of a previous edition.\n\nFive minutes earlier, the Reuters news agency had started sending out one-line news flashes summarising contents of the report.\n\nThis was followed by a brief spell of volatility in the UK bond and currency markets.\n\nGilt yields - which give an indication of government borrowing costs - fell sharply, before climbing back to above the level they had been at before the details were leaked.\n\nMr Hughes acknowledged the "deep disruption" caused, and said he took responsibility "on behalf of the OBR" for "inadvertently allowing" early access to document.\n\nAsked on Wednesday if he would resign, he said: "I\'ve given you a statement, that is all I have to say."\n\nReacting to the leak in the Politics Live studio, BBC political editor Chris Mason said: "The sheer absurdity of reading out something the chancellor has not yet announced in the Commons is mind-blowing".\n\nBBC economics editor Faisal Islam said: "I think I need a red box, I can deliver the Budget now in the studio... It tells you all the measures, it tells you all the big stats we were just speculating over."\n\nThe unexpected release caused a reaction in the Commons chamber as Prime Minister\'s Questions (PMQs) started, with Reeves seen looking at her own phone with concern, before Treasury Minister Torsten Bell, who was sitting behind her, passed his mobile phone to her as the news broke.\n\nNotes were being passed down the row of cabinet ministers before the Chief secretary to the Treasury James Murray held his phone in front of Reeves and she copied down some words onto the top of what seemed to be her Budget speech.\n\nConservative MPs quickly started posting pages of the document on social media and Tory frontbenchers, including shadow chancellor Mel Stride, were seen whispering and making notes.\n\nStride then called a  point of order at the end of PMQs to demand an inquiry into the leak, saying: "It is utterly outrageous that this has happened and this leak may constitute a criminal act."\n\nThere have already been weeks of leaks and speculation over policy to the media in the run-up to the Budget, which the chancellor was reprimanded for by deputy speaker Nus Ghani.\n\nAlthough this is the first time the OBR has made this sort of mistake, it is not the first time parts of the Budget have leaked out before they should have done.\n\nBack in 2013, the Evening Standard mistakenly published\n\nbefore he got to his feet in the Commons, including details of major announcements on tax.\n\nThe then-Labour leader Ed Miliband was reading a photocopy of the front page as Osborne spoke and said the chancellor "almost need not have bothered coming" to the Commons.\n\nIn 1996, the Daily Mirror was sent the full contents of Chancellor Ken Clarke\'s Budget in advance of his speech.\n\nPiers Morgan, who was the paper\'s editor at the time, only published some details in the next day\'s paper, sending the rest back to the Treasury.\n\nAt the time, prime minister John Major ordered a leak inquiry and the Metropolitan Police investigated, but no one was arrested.\n\nIn 1947, the Labour Chancellor Hugh Dalton was forced to resign after giving a journalist details of the Budget before making his statement.\n\nto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

There are always a lot of moving parts when you project long term.\n\nYes the economy is forecast to grow more slowly than expected because long-term productivity has been downgraded, but it also starts from a better base thanks to outperformance and upgrades this year.\n\nOn top of that, higher wages due to high inflation have boosted the Treasury's tax take. Very interestingly, the OBR has also made a judgement that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could boost productivity by a notable and growing amount by the end of the decade.\n\nThe net result of all that is the OBR forecasts show she could have met her self-imposed rules of only borrowing to invest and cover day-to-day spending with tax  receipts, without\n\nSo why did she do way more than expected? By freezing thresholds for a further three years until 2031, she is dragging most people into paying more tax including pulling almost one in four people into the higher rate tax bracket.\n\nIf it wasn't for her U-turn on welfare reforms, she would have been on track to actually meet her target by a whisker before she made any changes to tax and spending.\n\nSo this gets us to the big story of this Budget of two halves. A Budget that borrows to spend on political priorities in the next year or so, and then taxes hard to get borrowing down in the final years of the decade.\n\nThis is about buying breathing space, politically and economically. The two factors are inseparable.\n\nBy borrowing to spend, the chancellor and prime minister have shored up their immediate position in parliament and it appears to put to bed the shocking doubts  about passing their budgets.\n\nThe Labour left is getting behind this Budget as it spends to help alleviate child poverty, to lower energy bills, and to freeze rail fares and prescriptions. This is important for the financial markets which need to know, whether they love the policies or not, that the government has the votes to pass its Budget.\n\nBy subsequently taxing hard to double the amount of breathing space or headroom to £22bn a year around her borrowing targets, Reeves gets space from the uncomfortable glare of the markets. Add in the fact that there will now only be an annual check of the fiscal rules rather than a bi-annual one, and with a fair wind, this should put to bed the hamster wheel of speculation about missing borrowing targets.\n\nThis has been a force for instability, and lack of credibility over the last year, and ultimately led to the calamitous U-turn on welfare cuts over the summer.\n\nThe net result of all this and a slightly lower than expected issuance of UK government bonds, was that markets were more than calm. Despite the rollercoaster of a day, the effective interest rate on government bonds was down across the board, and on occasion was a notable 10 basis points or 0.1% down on the key bonds.\n\nThe message has been heard in the markets, and at first glance in her own party.\n\nNow this has come at a price. Taxes will go up to new records in 2028. How will that be squared with the need for growth?\n\nI detect an unspoken strategy. The government hopes that growth will exceed the solid pedestrian predictions of 1.5%. If that is the case, we might not ever get to this extended threshold freeze.\n\nThere is also hope the choices made will enable the Bank of England to cut interest rates further.\n\nFor this to work, growth will have to come. There is some space for green shoots to sprout now, or at least for the animal spirits of the economy to emerge from non-stop chaos. This applies to business investment plans, and those older consumers who have been hoarding savings and not spending.\n\nIt's no guarantee of success, but there is some space now for a more stable backdrop.", 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 53, 101071), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 53, 101071)}

Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with "many" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\n\n"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period," the minutes said. "Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year."\n\nIn Fed parlance, "many" is more than "several," indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, "participants" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it\'s unclear how the voting members\' sentiment is set for a December move.\n\nHowever, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair\n\n\'s post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a "foregone conclusion."\n\n"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee\'s December meeting," the minutes said.\n\nPrevious to Powell\'s statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group\'s FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.\n\nThe minutes did note that "most participants" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.\n\nUltimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.\n\nOfficials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has "shown little sign of returning sustainably" to the Fed\'s 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\n\n"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range," the minutes said.\n\nAt the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how "restrictive" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that "the resilience of economic activity" indicated that policy is not restrictive.\n\nJudging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.\n\nIn between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.\n\nThe minutes noted that "one participant," a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.\n\nThe meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.\n\nPowell compared the situation to "driving in the fog," though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.\n\nThe minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion. There appeared to be widespread approval for the halting of a process known as quantitative tightening.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 53, 302814), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 53, 302814)}

Though she conceded that "ordinary people" will\n\nin the coming years, the chancellor has also argued it will require those with the "broadest shoulders" to pay more.\n\nMs Reeves has also stressed that other measures in the Budget - such as freezing rail fares in England and fuel duty across the UK and removing some costs from domestic electricity bills - will ease the cost of living squeeze for many families.\n\nAnd the government estimates that the decision to scrap the two child limit on benefits will reduce relative child poverty by 450,000 by the end of the Parliament and raise average incomes in affected families by £5,310 a year.\n\nSo do these claims add up?\n\nBBC Verify has examined what we know about how the Budget is likely to financially affect different groups.\n\nThe impact of the Budget will depend on the individual characteristics of each household.\n\nFor instance, someone on a low income who does not have more than two children will not benefit from the scrapping of the two child benefit cap. And someone on a modest income who drives an electric vehicle would be hit by the new mileage charge for EVs.\n\nSimilarly, someone on a higher income who gets a lot of mileage out of their petrol car or uses a lot of energy at home could benefit more from the measures intended to help people with the high cost of living instead of people on lower incomes.\n\nhas produced some representative households to demonstrate these different effects:\n\nIt finds that, as a result of all the tax and benefit changes since the Autumn Budget in 2024, lower income households are more likely to benefit than to lose out financially, while for higher income households it\'s the reverse.\n\nIt also finds that pensioner households are more likely to benefit from Reeves\' budget measures than working-age households, with 56% benefiting versus only 33% of families with children.\n\nMeasures in the Budget such as the new high value council tax surcharge in England (set to raise £400m a year in 2029-30) and the increased income tax rates on property, savings and dividend income (set to raise £2.1bn a year) will predominantly fall on people with higher incomes since richer people tend to have more property wealth and more income from those sources.\n\nThe same is true of the plan to charge National Insurance on pension contributions made through workplace salary sacrifice schemes (set to raise £4.7bn).\n\nsuggests that by 2028-29 the tax measures in the Budget will reduce the incomes of the top 10% of earners in the UK population by around £2,000.\n\nBy contrast, the incomes of middle earners will be lower by around £300 and the incomes of the bottom 20% of earners will be some £200 lower.\n\nMost earners will lose out because of the decision to extend the freeze in income tax thresholds by an additional three years from 2027-28. It drags more people - including those on relatively modest incomes - into paying more tax as their incomes rise with inflation.\n\nThose currently earning below the personal allowance of £12,571 will find, as wages rise but thresholds don\'t, they will pay tax for the first time. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates it could be as many as 780,000 more people paying tax by 2029-30.\n\nThe Treasury\'s analysis also suggests that people on lower incomes will benefit much more than richer people from measures such as taking costs off electricity bills, freezing fuel duty and the scrapping of the two child limit, with the top 30% of earners seeing little cash gain.\n\nin the Budget together in its own analysis.\n\nThe think tank finds that by 2030-31 the net impact of these measures will be that the incomes of the lowest 20% of earners will be higher by between £220 and £290, whereas the incomes of the top 10% will be lower by around £700.\n\nIt\'s worth bearing in mind, however, that these calculations only show the impact of the Budget measures.\n\nDetermining what actually happens to people\'s incomes overall, wherever they are in the UK\'s income distribution, will be how the wider economy performs.\n\nAnd the downgrade in the OBR\'s latest overall UK growth forecast means it also now projects average UK real household disposable incomes (RHDI) per person - the Government\'s chosen target measure of living standards - to grow by just 0.5 per cent a year on average by the end of the Parliament.\n\nAccording to the Resolution Foundation, that would mean average income growth of just £740 (in 2025-26 money) over the Parliament, which would make this the second worst Parliament for income growth on record.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 54, 942410), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 54, 942410)}

"The more testing and data you can collect from trips taken, the more likely the AI sensors are able to recognize the objects on the road, which means better safety as well."\n\nHe cautioned that despite some initial progress, the robotaxi race remains uncertain as "no one has truly had mass adoption for their vehicles."\n\nCoverage remains limited. Even in China, robotaxis are only allowed to operate in selected zones, though Pony.ai recently became the first to\n\nto operate its robotaxis across all of Shenzhen, dubbed China\'s Silicon Valley. In Beijing, self-driving taxis are mostly limited to a suburb called Yizhuang.\n\nAnecdotally, CNBC tests have found Pony.ai offered a smoother ride than Apollo Go, which was prone to hard braking.\n\nAs for safety — which is critical for regulatory approval — none of the six operators has reported fatalities or major injuries caused by the robotaxis so far.

The threshold in England was reduced to £25,000 for students who started a degree in 2023 onwards.\n\nThis means each year, workers earning above that amount will be dragged into making larger repayments on their student loans than they would have if thresholds rose in line with inflation.\n\nStudent loan repayments typically\n\nReeves also unveiled a new\n\n, which will see universities charged £925 per overseas student per year from August 2028, with an exemption for 220 students per year.\n\nThe income raised by the levy will be used to fund maintenance grants for disadvantaged students studying so-called priority courses such as university degrees and technical qualifications.\n\nThe chancellor made an appeal to renters in her Budget speech, saying it is unfair that income from work is taxed more than income made by landlords.\n\nReeves set out plans to raise the tax rate on income from properties by 2%.\n\nBut the changes risked contributing to "a steady long-term rise in rents", the official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned.\n\nThis is because landlords may leave the private rental market, limiting supply and pushing up prices for renters, it said.\n\nThe chancellor set aside £1.5bn over the next five years to help 16 to 24-year-olds into work or training.\n\nReeves said £820m will go towards her\n\nplacements to young people who have been out of work, education or training for 18 months.\n\nIt is part of a drive by the government to reduce the number of people out of work, with those who refuse to take up the offer facing the threat of being stripped of their benefits.\n\nA further £725m will go towards making the training of under-25 apprentices free for small and medium sized firms.\n\nThe chancellor\'s decision to scrap a tax loophole on small parcels could see some online shopping get more expensive from 2029.\n\nallows overseas retailers to send goods to the UK worth up to £135 without incurring customs duty.\n\nBritish retailers have been highly critical of the loophole, arguing it undercuts high street firms, and wanted the change to be introduced sooner.\n\nIt means brands that benefit from this loophole, like Shein and Temu, are likely to up their prices when it’s closed.\n\nIf you grab a pre-made latte with your lunch or a protein shake on the way back from the gym you could be hit by the\n\nPre-packaged milkshakes and coffees with high sugar content will face an extra tax from 2028.\n\nThe threshold at which the sugar levy applies will be 4.5g of sugar per 100ml, down from 5g.\n\nThe change, part of a bid to tackle childhood obesity, could mean an extra tax on popular products like Yazoo, Muller\'s Frijj and Starbucks Caffe Latte as well as drinks branded "high protein" like Ufit and Shaken Udder.\n\nReeves promised a "new, simpler" way to help first-time buyers onto the property ladder.\n\nThere will be a consultation in early 2026 on what could be a\n\nAnyone under 40 can open a Lisa to either help save towards retirement or buy a first home. Savers can put in up to £4,000 a year and the government will top it up by 25%.\n\nFrequent complaints about the Lisa include that savers face a penalty for withdrawing money early, meaning they could lose 6.25% of their own savings.\n\nCritics have also called for the £450,000 threshold for properties eligible to be purchased using a Lisa to be increased, having been unchanged since 2017.\n\nThe consultation could also see the retirement aspect of Lisas removed in favour of focusing solely on first-time buyers.\n\nIf you use trains or buses to get about then the good news is fares won\'t be going up for now.\n\nFor the first time in three decades, the chancellor announced that regulated rail fares in England\n\nTypically the fares, which include season tickets for most commuter routes, are uprated in line with inflation plus 1%. The most recent increase, in March 2025, was 4.6%.\n\nThe bus fare cap of £3 for a single journey, covering most bus journeys in England, is already in place until March 2027.\n\nThe chancellor\'s decision to extend a freeze on income tax thresholds is likely to push up your tax bill.\n\nAnyone entering the workforce with an annual income over £12,570 has to pay tax, a figure Reeves previously said would rise in line with inflation from 2028.\n\nNot only will those at the start of their careers pay more tax sooner, the freeze until 2031 will see more taxpayers cross the £50,271 higher rate threshold than otherwise would have.\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 56, 708052), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 20, 56, 708052)}

That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.\n\nThe target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.\n\nThose expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\nHowever, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it\'s been since October 2021.\n\n"All those numbers suggest an economy that\'s still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other," Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don\'t think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other."\n\nTo be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight.\n\n"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate," wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

On that score, this Budget is a big improvement on last year\'s.\n\nBy building in a lot more wiggle room in her tax and spending plans over the next five year, Rachel Reeves has reduced the likelihood we will need such a bewildering smorgasbord of policies next year.\n\nStability can be a powerful fertiliser for growth.\n\nThe former chief economist of the Bank of England Andy Haldane may have over egged it by saying that the "fiscal fandango" - the months of speculation before this year\'s Budget - was the single biggest reason for growth to flatline for the second half of the year, but it sure didn\'t help.\n\nAhead of the Budget, Steve Rigby, the boss of large private company Rigby told the BBC, "we just hope [it] isn\'t too catastrophic for business and we can get on with it".\n\nTest passed he says - but that\'s a pretty low bar for a government desperate for growth.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 2, 121325), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 2, 121325)}

More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.\n\nThere have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.\n\nIn January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.\n\nto deal with overcrowding.\n\nMost of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece.

{'source_site': 'BBC Business', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c751xw96e9yo', 'title': 'Will boats be a breakthrough for 3D printing tech?', 'body': 'The final test was a blunt one. Maarten Logtenberg wielded a sledgehammer, which simply bounced off the sample, barely leaving a scratch.\n\nAfter two years of experimentation, the material was finally right: a particular mix of thermoplastics and fibreglass that is strong, has no need of extra coating to protect it from sunlight, and is resistant to fouling and marine growth.\n\nThe perfect base, says Mr Logtenberg, from which to 3D print a boat.\n\nBoats need to withstand the unforgiving nature of the marine environment. It\'s one of the reasons why boatbuilding is a notoriously labour-intensive business.\n\nBut after months of tweaking the chemistry, it took just four days for the first hull to roll off the printer at the new factory that Mr Logtenberg and his colleagues run.\n\n"We\'re automating almost 90% of the boat-building process, and in superfast time," he says.\n\n"Normally it takes weeks to build a hull. We print one now every week."\n\nIt\'s the kind of story that 3D printing has long promised. A quick, labour-saving production process that drastically reduces costs.\n\nThose promises haven\'t always been fulfilled – but Mr Logtenberg is convinced that the maritime sector is one where 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can play a transformational role.\n\nMr Logtenberg is the co-founder of CEAD, a company that designs and builds large-format 3D printers at its base in the Dutch town of Delft.\n\nUntil now, its business has been to provide the printers for others to use, but with boatbuilding CEAD decided to get involved in production as well.\n\n"3D printed boats still need to be accepted by the market," says Mr Logtenberg.\n\n"People are not going to invest and then just hope that the market will develop. They would rather buy in capacity first. [So] instead of just building machines, we\'re going to do it ourselves."\n\nTraditional fibreglass boat building requires a mould and considerable manual work to make sure the vessel is of the required strength.\n\nIn additive manufacturing, the work has already been done at the design stage, in creating the software and the printer itself (which is labour intensive).\n\n3D printers work by building up tiny layers of the basic material, to a predetermined digital design.\n\nEach layer then bonds to the previous one to allow the creation of a single, seamless object.\n\nIn the production phase, as long as there is a supply of the base material, there is little or no need for human intervention.\n\nThe design can also be adjusted without the need for major changes in the build process.\n\nMuch 3D printing operates on a relatively small scale – dentistry is one area where it has made a major impact. To create a boat capable of operating in real world conditions is a different challenge.\n\nCEAD\'s largest 3D printer is nearly 40m (131ft) long, and has been used by a customer in Abu Dhabi to print an electric ferry.\n\nAnd in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy.\n\n"Normally when the Navy buys a boat, it takes them years before they receive it and they pay quite some money," says Mr Logtenberg.\n\n"We did it in six weeks and for a very limited budget. And we can learn from it and build another one in six weeks and even recycle the first one."\n\nAnother fast growth area is the use of unmanned vessels – nautical drones. CEAD recently took part in a test with Nato Special Forces in which drones were built on site in a matter of hours, with designs changing according to operational requirements.\n\nThe ability to relocate production makes 3D printing incredibly flexible, according to Mr Logtenberg.\n\nEven a substantial printer can be carried in a shipping container and taken much closer to the end user.\n\n"It doesn\'t matter whether it\'s a 6m small work boat or a 12m military boat. The machine just takes it all as long as we have the design.\n\n"The only transport we need to do is the base material, which comes in big bags and it\'s very transport efficient, compared to a boat."\n\nNot far from CEAD, in the port city of Rotterdam, a company called Raw Idea and their \'Tanaruz\' brand are looking at making a similar impact in the leisure market, especially rentals.\n\n"Consumers are hesitant [because of the novelty], but the rental market is really keen," says Joyce Pont, Raw Idea\'s managing director.\n\n"It\'s marketing, you can go to the socials and say, \'we\'ve got a 3D printed boat\', and everybody wants to look at and touch that boat."\n\nAnother selling point is that Raw Idea uses a mix of glass fibre and recycled consumer plastics (fizzy drinks bottles and so on).\n\nThat\'s one reason why the price is currently comparable to a traditionally-built boat, because recycled material costs more to buy.\n\nBut Ms Pont says scale and flexibility will bring costs down significantly.\n\n"I\'m convinced that in five years from now, 3D printed boats will take over the market for the fast-driving boat, like work boats, like speed boats," she tells me.\n\nThe marine industry is intensely regulated but the certification authorities are having to keep pace with innovation.\n\nBoth RAW Idea and CEAD are engaging with European regulators almost in real time, as they use new materials and new ideas to produce vessels that cannot be compared to what has come before.\n\n3D printing has often been hailed as a revolutionary technology but hasn\'t always delivered on those hopes.\n\nMr Logtenberg says that\'s because the technique is used in multiple different contexts.\n\n"It\'s all being seen as one thing, but you have metal printing, you have polymer or large-scale printing, all these different applications.\n\n"There are many applications that didn\'t succeed because it was not competitive enough, but there are a few where it actually happened and is being used."\n\nAdditive manufacturing is being used more frequently in the shipping industry, but in technical niches, rather than entire hulls.\n\nHow far could 3D printing go in the maritime world? We are a long way from entire ships being printed in one go.\n\nJoyce Pont is sceptical whether that moment will arrive in the foreseeable future – she sees the building of superyachts and other such vessels as a \'craft\' which will resist automation.\n\nBut Mr Logtenberg is more optimistic.\n\n"Building a 12-meter boat, I never expected that a year ago," he says.\n\n"Traditional shipbuilding is done in modules. It\'s going to take maybe a decade or two before we are going to completely print [a ship\'s hull], because there will be more need of material research.\n\n"But thermal plastics are being developed and improved all the time.

Taiwan rejects this claim and says that only its people can decide its future.\n\n"The pace and scale of Beijing\'s reactions ... are quite unprecedented," said George Chen, partner of The Asia Group, a business policy consultancy based in Washington, D.C.

He said he organized a Japanese concert in Shanghai on Wednesday with no issue, and "nobody has said to us that Saturday[\'s concert] is for sure canceled."\n\nHowever, China\'s rhetoric remains firm, with the foreign ministry on Thursday calling again for Takaichi to\n\nand warning that "if Japan creates trouble on Taiwan, Japan will not get away with it."\n\n"Basically what that means is, I have no hope for Saturday," Petersen-Clausen added.\n\nThe venue had expected around 200 attendees on Thursday alone, he said, adding that around 20 Chinese people would have gotten paid for related work around both shows. Tickets for the jazz performance were listed at the equivalent of between $40 and $70 each.\n\nThe movie industry could also come under pressure. The local release of Japanese animated films featuring Crayon Shinchan and the "Cells at Work" series have been postponed, Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Wednesday.\n\nbased on falling Chinese interest in Japanese films.\n\n"The risk to Beijing is that the perception that it has overreacted reinforces anti-China sentiment in Japan, as it did in South Korea," Teneo analysts said in a report.\n\n"If Beijing chooses to continue ramping up pressure over the incident, additional measures could include new barriers to imports from Japan justified by trade investigations or product safety concerns."\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, international music performances are often the first affected by geopolitical disputes.\n\nFollowing Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, some venues in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nappearances or shows involving artists believed to be supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin. China has also\n\nfor nearly a decade to protest a new missile system, although there are indications these acts could return soon.\n\nFor Petersen-Clausen, the uncertainty around concerts in China is hurting business.\n\n"Foreign musicians have refused bookings from us because they said we don\'t know if it will actually go ahead or be canceled," he said. "This word has gotten around that China is sometimes unstable.

"Mega offers like never before." - it\'s hard to escape the ads this Black Friday.\n\nWhether you\'re excited for the seasonal sales or avoiding the shops altogether, one thing is clear - the US shopping event which follows Thanksgiving has been fully embraced by UK retailers.\n\nBut research from Consumer group Which? reveals that eight in 10 Black Friday deals were actually cheaper or the same price at other times of the year. In other words, many deals may not be as good as they seem.\n\nIf you\'re still planning to shop, here\'s how to make sure you get a good deal.\n\nSome retailers create the illusion of a big discount by raising prices in the weeks before Black Friday, only to drop them again during the "sale".\n\nWebsites such as PriceRunner or CamelCamelCamel let you look at previous prices so you can work out whether a discount is genuine.\n\nFor example, according to Price Runner, the cheapest Apple ipad overall was selling online for £309 on the 19 October. By 10 November it had increased to £391.99. When the Black Friday sales launched on 21 November, it was back down to £309.\n\nThis tactic isn\'t illegal, but it can easily mislead shoppers into thinking they\'re getting a far bigger discount than they really are, consumer champion, Rebecca Wilcox told Morning Live.\n\nAI can help too, says retail analyst Natalie Berg, host of the Retail Disrupted podcast. "You can ask ChatGPT: \'Show me the best Black Friday deals for a 10-year-old who loves the movie Wicked.\' You don\'t need to trawl through different sites, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming."\n\nShoppers often hold off buying items hoping they\'ll be cheaper down the line.\n\nBut none of the 175 products tracked by Which? were at their cheapest price of the year on the day of Black Friday itself.\n\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth says: "There is a huge risk in [holding out], because the products you want to buy may not be available anymore."\n\nShe says higher costs this year means retailers are less likely to have surplus stock.\n\nSo if you do find the product you\'re after and it\'s at a price you\'re happy with, Shuttleworth recommends buying it - and keeping your receipt.\n\nMany retailers will refund the difference if prices fall again. Some companies, like Currys and Argos, offer a Black Friday guarantee.\n\nIf you do find it cheaper within the returns period you could always take it back it and buy again at the lower price.\n\nDon\'t just think about big-ticket items. Some of the biggest markdowns are on everyday items such as quilted toilet roll and dishwasher tablets, Kat Cereda from consumer watchdog Which?\n\nStart by deciding what you actually need. If you\'re looking for a specific brand, check their website directly and join their mailing list for early access to their sales.\n\n"The tech is there to help retailers offer more real-time rewards and target their best shoppers," says Berg.\n\nDon\'t fall for pressure tactics such as "selling fast" or "only two left", which can fuel impulse buying, the competition watchdog warns.\n\nAnd if you\'re spending over £100, then it recommends using a credit card.\n\n"You have legal protection that means you can claim for a refund if the company goes bust, your item doesn\'t arrive, or if there are certain other problems such as an item being faulty or not as described," says Hayley Fletcher from the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nScammers ramp up activity around major events like Black Friday and can take advantage of the urgency shoppers may feel. Fake websites and counterfeit goods often spike during this period, posing as limited-time deals to lure people in.\n\n"If something seems too good to be true or doesn\'t feel right, it might be a scam. Don\'t rush your purchase. Research the company you\'re buying from and be wary of suspicious web links," says Jane Parsons, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.\n\nThis year, TikTok shop has become an increasingly popular destination for Black Friday discounts, with brands such as M&S, L\'Oréal and Rituals selling directly on the app.\n\n"You can find flash sales not available on a retailer\'s site," says Berg.

We always do our best to make those spaces safe and accessible to everybody.\n\n"Touts steal from artists and they steal from fans. They create inequality and hysteria.\n\n"Capping resale at face value is your right and we have a duty to encourage a fair resale market.\n\n"We are often made to feel we don\'t have a choice but there is always space to ask why and it is always your right to say no!\n\n"It\'s not every day that you feel heard and understood," she concluded, "so today is good day."', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 6, 293545), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 6, 293545)}

Workers are not guaranteed hours from employers, but they also do not have to work when asked.\n\nUnder the new legislation, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period.\n\nEmployees who prefer having a zero-hours contract will be able to remain on those terms if they want to - the change is that they will have the right for guaranteed working hours if they want them.\n\nWorkers on zero-hours contracts will also be entitled to "reasonable" notice ahead of any changes being made to their shifts, as well as compensation if a shift is cancelled or ended early.\n\nFlexible working is to become the "default" for all workers, with employers required to say yes to requests from staff from their first day starting in a job unless they can prove it is "unreasonable".\n\nThe government defines flexible working as a way of working "that suits an employee’s needs", for example, having flexible start and finish times, or working from home.\n\nEmployees can already request flexible working from their first day in a job, but an employer can refuse an application if they have a good business reason for doing so.\n\nIt is unclear if there will be a big shift from current rules and there appear to be many reasons available to employers to refuse flexible working in the new bill.\n\nThe grounds against granting requests\n\nThe waiting period and lower earnings limit to receive Statutory Sick Pay will be removed.\n\nAround 1.3 million low-paid workers in the UK are to be entitled to 80% of their weekly salary as sick pay from the first day of illness, under the government plans.\n\nCurrently, to qualify for sick pay, you must have been ill for more than three days in a row and earn an average of at least £123 per week.\n\nUnder the plans, employees will be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from the first day they are ill and those earning under £123 per week will also be eligible for it.\n\nYou can get £116.75 per week Statutory Sick Pay if you’re too ill to work and it is paid by your employer for up to 28 weeks. Some can get more if their company has a sick pay scheme.\n\nParents are currently only allowed to take unpaid parental leave if they have been with a company for more than a year.

And she said that even with lower multipliers for small retail, leisure and hospitality firms she is still facing a 15% increase in her business rates bill.\n\n"She may well have said it\'s the lowest rate and the best support but it\'s from the highest base," Ms Wrigley said.\n\nShe added: "We\'ve put our prices up four times in the last 12 months, but we\'re at a point now where we feel like we can\'t put any more on to our customers, so subsequently our margins are being reduced and being squeezed which is not helpful."\n\nAnd Sacha Lord, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said the business rates changes amount to a "stealth tax" on High Street pubs, restaurants and bars.\n\nHe told the BBC operators initially welcomed the Budget, but the impact of revaluations became clear within hours of the chancellor\'s statement.\n\n"Once this kicks in in April, we are expecting to see more closures than ever before, including during the pandemic," Mr Lord warned.', 'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 10, 468700), 'crawl_datetime': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 17, 21, 10, 468700)}
